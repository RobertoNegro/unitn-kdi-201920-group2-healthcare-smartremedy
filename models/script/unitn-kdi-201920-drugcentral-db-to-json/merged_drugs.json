LEXISCAN is a pharmacologic stress agent indicated for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress (1).","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability, who may be at greater risk. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administration (5.1). Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia (5.2). Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter. New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported (5.3). Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, and rashes have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.4). Hypotension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, induce vasodilation and hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency, or hypovolemia (5.5). Hypertension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, may induce clinically significant increases in blood pressure particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and when the MPI includes low level exercise (5.6). Bronchoconstriction. Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, may induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Resuscitative measures should be available (5.7). Seizure. LEXISCAN may lower the seizure threshold. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred. Some seizures are prolonged and require urgent anticonvulsive management. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with LEXISCAN (5.8). Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke). Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.9). 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest have occurred following LEXISCAN injection. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to LEXISCAN. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering LEXISCAN. If serious reactions to LEXISCAN occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by LEXISCAN [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first-degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of LEXISCAN administration; transient second-degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving LEXISCAN. In post-marketing experience, third-degree heart block and asystole within minutes of LEXISCAN administration have occurred [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported following LEXISCAN injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria and rashes have occurred. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in fewer than 1 percent of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available. 5.5 Hypotension Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 minutes of LEXISCAN administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In post-marketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed [see Adverse Reactions(6.2)]. 5.6 Hypertension Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of LEXISCAN administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, may cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to and following LEXISCAN administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Overdosage (10) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Seizure LEXISCAN may lower the seizure threshold; obtain a seizure history. New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following LEXISCAN injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with LEXISCAN injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with LEXISCAN administration. 5.9 Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of LEXISCAN including hypotension or hypertension may be associated with these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and (5.6)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer LEXISCAN to patients with: Second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus node dysfunction unless these patients have a functioning artificial pacemaker [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

During clinical development, 1,651 patients were exposed to LEXISCAN, with most receiving 0.4 mg as a rapid ( 10 seconds) intravenous injection. Most of these patients received LEXISCAN in two clinical studies that enrolled patients who had no history of bronchospastic lung disease as well as no history of a cardiac conduction block of greater than first-degree AV block, except for patients with functioning artificial pacemakers. In these studies (Studies 1 and 2), 2,015 patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging after administration of LEXISCAN (N = 1,337) or ADENOSCAN (N=678). The population was 2693 years of age (median 66 years), 70% male and primarily Caucasian (76% Caucasian, 7% African American, 9% Hispanic, 5% Asian). Table 1 shows the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Overall, any adverse reaction occurred at similar rates between the study groups (80% for the LEXISCAN group and 83% for the ADENOSCAN group). Aminophylline was used to treat the reactions in 3% of patients in the LEXISCAN group and 2% of patients in the ADENOSCAN group. Most adverse reactions began soon after dosing, and generally resolved within approximately 15 minutes, except for headache which resolved in most patients within 30 minutes.

Most respiratory adverse reactions resolved without therapy; a few patients received aminophylline or a short-acting bronchodilator. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the reduction of >15% from baseline at two-hours in FEV1 (Table 3).

Inadequate Exercise Stress In an open-label, multi-center trial evaluating LEXISCAN administration following inadequate exercise stress, 1,147 patients were randomized into one of two groups. Each group underwent two LEXISCAN stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) procedures. Group 1 received LEXISCAN 3 minutes following inadequate exercise in the first LEXISCAN stress (MPI 1). Group 2 rested 1 hour after inadequate exercise to allow hemodynamics to return to baseline prior to receiving LEXISCAN (MPI 1). Both groups returned for a second stress MPI 1-14 days later and received LEXISCAN without exercise (MPI 2). The most common adverse reactions are similar in type and incidence to those in Table 1 above for both Groups. The timing of the administration of LEXISCAN did not alter the common adverse reaction profile. Table 4 shows a comparison of cardiac events of interest for the two groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The cardiac events were numerically higher in Group 1. Table 4 Cardiac Events of Interest in Inadequate Exercise Stress Study Cardiac EventA clinically significant cardiac event was defined as any of the following events found on the Holter ECG/12-lead ECG within one hour after regadenoson administration: ventricular arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de Pointes, ventricular flutter); ST-T depression ( 2 mm); ST-T elevation ( 1 mm); AV block (2:1 AV block, AV Mobitz I, AV Mobitz II, complete heart block); sinus arrest > 3 seconds in duration Or a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) per the MedDRA SMQ (narrow Scope) for myocardial infarction Or a TEAE preferred term (PT) of angina unstable within 24 hours of regadenoson administration.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (new-onset or recurrent), atrial flutter, heart block (including third-degree block), asystole, marked hypertension, symptomatic hypotension in association with transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), seizures and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.2), (5.3), (5.5), (5.6) and (5.8)] have been reported. Some events required intervention with fluids and/or aminophylline [see Overdosage (10)]. QTc prolongation shortly after LEXISCAN administration has been reported. Central Nervous System Tremor, seizure, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident including intracranial hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and (5.9)]. Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain, occasionally severe, has been reported a few minutes after LEXISCAN administration, in association with nausea, vomiting, or myalgias; administration of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, appeared to lessen the pain. Diarrhea and fecal incontinence have also been reported following LEXISCAN administration. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, rashes have occurred and have required treatment including resuscitation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain has occurred, typically 10-20 minutes after LEXISCAN administration; the pain was occasionally severe, localized in the arms and lower back and extended to the buttocks and lower legs bilaterally. Administration of aminophylline appeared to lessen the pain. Respiratory Respiratory arrest, dyspnea and wheezing have been reported following LEXISCAN administration.","drugClass":"regadenoson","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended intravenous dose of LEXISCAN is 5 mL (0.4 mg regadenoson) Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Important Limitations of Use (1.3): Do not use for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes or for treating diabetic ketoacidosis. WELCHOL has not been studied in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor and has not been extensively studied in combination with thiazolidinediones. WELCHOL has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias. WELCHOL has not been studied in children younger than 10 years of age or in pre-menarchal girls. 1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia WELCHOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson Type IIa) as monotherapy or in combination with an hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin). WELCHOL is indicated as monotherapy or in combination with a statin to reduce LDL-C levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: a. LDL-C remains 190 mg/dL or b. LDL-C remains 160 mg/dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate [See Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents such as diabetes mellitus, LDL-C treatment goals are < 100 mg/dL. An LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. If LDL-C is at goal but the serum triglyceride (TG) value is > 200 mg/dL, then non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (total cholesterol [TC] minus high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) becomes a secondary target of therapy. The goal for non-HDL-C in persons with high serum TG is set at 30 mg/dL higher than that for LDL-C. 1.2 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus WELCHOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Diabetes mellitus is considered a CHD risk equivalent. In addition to glycemic control, intensive lipid control is warranted [See Indications and Usage (1.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 1.3 Important Limitations of Use WELCHOL should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. WELCHOL has not been studied in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor and has not been extensively studied in combination with thiazolidinediones. WELCHOL has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias. WELCHOL has not been studied in children younger than 10 years of age or in pre-menarchal girls.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The effect of WELCHOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined (5.1). WELCHOL can increase TG, particularly when used with insulin or sulfonylureas. Marked hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis. The effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the risk of coronary artery disease is uncertain. Monitor lipids, including TG and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (5.2). Bile acid sequestrants may decrease absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Use caution in patients susceptible to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (5.3). Because of its constipating effects, WELCHOL is not recommended in patients at risk of bowel obstruction (e.g., patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders or a history of major gastrointestinal surgery) (5.4). WELCHOL reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction with colesevelam at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Drugs that have not been tested for interaction with colesevelam, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, should also be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Alternatively, monitor drug levels of the co-administered drug (5.5, 7, 12.3). WELCHOL for Oral Suspension contains 24 mg phenylalanine per 1.875 gram packet and 48 mg phenylalanine per 3.75 gram packet (5.6, 11) 5.1 General The effect of WELCHOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 5.2 Serum Triglycerides (TG) WELCHOL, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum TG concentrations. WELCHOL had small effects on serum TG (median increase 5% compared to placebo) in trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels occurred when WELCHOL was used in combination with sulfonylureas (median increase 18% compared to placebo in combination with sulfonylureas) and when WELCHOL was used in combination with insulin (median increase 22% compared to placebo in combination with insulin) [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Hypertriglyceridemia of sufficient severity can cause acute pancreatitis. The long-term effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the risk of coronary artery disease is uncertain. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the effect of WELCHOL on LDL-C levels may be attenuated by WELCHOLs effects on TG levels and a smaller reduction in non-HDL-C compared to the reduction in LDL-C. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL. Because most patients in the WELCHOL clinical trials had baseline TG 500 mg/dL [See Contraindications (4)]. Lipid parameters, including TG levels and non-HDL-C, should be obtained before starting WELCHOL and periodically thereafter. WELCHOL should be discontinued if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL or if the patient develops hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies Precautions Bile acid sequestrants may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. No specific clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of WELCHOL on the absorption of co-administered dietary or supplemental vitamin therapy. In non-clinical safety studies, rats administered colesevelam hydrochloride at doses greater than 30-fold the projected human clinical dose experienced hemorrhage from vitamin K deficiency. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Disorders Because of its constipating effects, WELCHOL is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction. Because of the tablet size, WELCHOL Tablets can cause dysphagia or esophageal obstruction and should be used with caution in patients with dysphagia or swallowing disorders. To avoid esophageal distress, WELCHOL for Oral Suspension should not be taken in its dry form. Always mix WELCHOL for Oral Suspension with water before ingesting. 5.5 Drug Interactions WELCHOL reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Drugs with a known interaction with colesevelam should be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Drugs that have not been tested for interaction with colesevelam, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, should also be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Alternatively, the physician should monitor drug levels of the co-administered drug [See Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Phenylketonurics WELCHOL for Oral Suspension contains 24 mg phenylalanine per 1.875 gram packet and 48 mg phenylalanine per 3.75 gram packet [See Description (11)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS WELCHOL is contraindicated in patients with A history of bowel obstruction [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Serum TG concentrations >500 mg/dL [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] A history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Do not use in patients with a history of bowel obstruction (4) Do not use in patients with serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations >500 mg/dL (4) Do not use in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis (4)","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING WELCHOL (colesevelam hydrochloride) Tablets, 625 mg, are supplied as an off-white, solid tablet imprinted with the word Sankyo and C01 on one side.

In the diabetes trials, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.0% in WELCHOL-treated patients and 2.3% in placebo-treated patients(6.1). Postmarketing reports with concomitant WELCHOL administration include: Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin. Administer phenytoin 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin. Monitor INR. Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Administer thyroid hormones 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Other postmarketing reports include bowel obstruction, dysphagia, esophageal obstruction, fecal impaction, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and increased transaminases (5.5 ,6.2, 7, 12.3). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the lipid-lowering trials, 807 adult patients received at least one dose of WELCHOL (total exposure 199 patient-years). In the type 2 diabetes trials, 566 patients received at least one dose of WELCHOL (total exposure 209 patient-years). In clinical trials for the reduction of LDL-C, 68% of patients receiving WELCHOL vs. 64% of patients receiving placebo reported an adverse reaction. In clinical trials of type 2 diabetes, 60% of patients receiving WELCHOL vs. 56% of patients receiving placebo reported an adverse reaction. Primary Hyperlipidemia: In 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials, 807 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 18-86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 2% Hispanics, 1% Asians) and elevated LDL-C were treated with WELCHOL 1.5 g/day to 4.5 g/day from 4 to 24 weeks. Table 1 Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of WELCHOL for Primary Hyperlipidemia: Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% of Patients and More Commonly than in Patients Given Placebo, Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Number of Patients (%) WELCHOL N = 807 Placebo N = 258 Constipation 89 (11.0) 18 (7.0) Dyspepsia 67 (8.3) 9 (3.5) Nausea 34 (4.2) 10 (3.9) Accidental injury 30 (3.7) 7 (2.7) Asthenia 29 (3.6) 5 (1.9) Pharyngitis 26 (3.2) 5 (1.9) Flu syndrome 26 (3.2) 8 (3.1) Rhinitis 26 (3.2) 8 (3.1) Myalgia 17 (2.1) 1 (0.4) Pediatric Patients 10 to 17 Years of Age: In an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study boys and post menarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) (n=192), were treated with WELCHOL tablets (1.9-3.8 g, daily) or placebo tablets [See Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Table 2 Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of WELCHOL for Primary Hyperlipidemia in heFH Pediatric Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% of Patients and More Commonly than in Patients Given Placebo, Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Number of Patients (%) WELCHOL Placebo N = 129 N = 65 Nasopharyngitis 8 (6.2) 3 (4.6) Headache 5 (3.9) 2 (3.1) Fatigue 5 (3.9) 1 (1.5) Creatine Phosphokinase Increase 3 (2.3) 0 (0.0) Rhinitis 3 (2.3) 0 (0.0) Vomiting 3 (2.3) 1 (1.5) The reported adverse reactions during the additional 18-week open-label treatment period with WELCHOL 3.8 g per day were similar to those during the double-blind period and included headache (7.6%), nasopharyngitis (5.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9%), influenza (3.8%), and nausea (3.8%) [See Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The safety of WELCHOL in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 4 double-blind, 12-26 week, placebo-controlled clinical trials. These trials involved 1128 patients (566 patients on WELCHOL; 562 patients on placebo) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin when these agents were used alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents. Upon completion of the pivotal trials, 492 patients entered a 52-week open-label uncontrolled extension study during which all patients received WELCHOL 3.8 g/day while continuing background treatment with metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents. A total of 6.7% of WELCHOL-treated patients and 3.2% of placebo-treated patients were discontinued from the diabetes trials due to adverse reactions. This difference was driven mostly by gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as abdominal pain and constipation. One patient in the pivotal trials discontinued due to body rash and mouth blistering that occurred after the first dose of WELCHOL, which may represent a hypersensitivity reaction to WELCHOL. Table 3 Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of WELCHOL Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin, Insulin, Sulfonylureas: Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% of Patients and More Commonly than in Patients Given Placebo, Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Number of Patients (%) WELCHOL N = 566 Placebo N = 562 Constipation 49 (8.7) 11 (2.0) Nasopharyngitis 23 (4.1) 20 (3.6) Dyspepsia 22 (3.9) 8 (1.4) Hypoglycemia 17 (3.0) 13 (2.3) Nausea 17 (3.0) 8 (1.4) Hypertension 16 (2.8) 9 (1.6) Hypertriglyceridemia : Patients with fasting serum TG levels above 500 mg/dL were excluded from the diabetes clinical trials. In the phase 3 diabetes trials, 637 (63%) patients had baseline fasting serum TG levels less than 200 mg/dL, 261 (25%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 200 and 300 mg/dL, 111 (11%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 300 and 500 mg/dL, and 9 (1%) had fasting serum TG levels greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL. The median baseline fasting TG concentration for the study population was 172 mg/dL; the median post-treatment fasting TG was 195 mg/dL in the WELCHOL group and 177 mg/dL in the placebo group. WELCHOL therapy resulted in a median placebo-corrected increase in serum TG of 5% (p=0.22), 22% (p<0.001), and 18% (p<0.001) when added to metformin, insulin and sulfonylureas, respectively [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In comparison, WELCHOL resulted in a median increase in serum TG of 5% compared to placebo (p=0.42) in a 24-week monotherapy lipid-lowering trial [See Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Treatment-emergent fasting TG concentrations 500 mg/dL occurred in 4.1% of WELCHOL-treated patients compared to 2.0% of placebo-treated patients. Among these patients, the TG concentrations with WELCHOL (median 604 mg/dL; interquartile range 538-712 mg/dL) were similar to that observed with placebo (median 644 mg/dL; interquartile range 574-724 mg/dL). Two (0.4%) patients on WELCHOL and 2 (0.4%) patients on placebo developed TG elevations 1000 mg/dL. In all WELCHOL clinical trials, including studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with primary hyperlipidemia, there were no reported cases of acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia. It is unknown whether patients with more uncontrolled, baseline hypertriglyceridemia would have greater increases in serum TG levels with WELCHOL [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Cardiovascular adverse events : During the diabetes clinical trials, the incidence of patients with treatment-emergent serious adverse events involving the cardiovascular system was 3% (17/566) in the WELCHOL group and 2% (10/562) in the placebo group. These overall rates included disparate events (e.g., myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, and bradycardia); therefore, the significance of this imbalance is unknown. Hypoglycemia : Adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on the clinical judgment of the blinded investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. The overall reported incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.0% in patients treated with WELCHOL and 2.3% in patients treated with placebo. No WELCHOL treated patients developed severe hypoglycemia. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of WELCHOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Drug Interactions with concomitant WELCHOL administration include: Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin. Phenytoin should be administered 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy. In warfarin-treated patients, INR should be monitored frequently during WELCHOL initiation then periodically thereafter. Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid hormone replacement should be administered 4 hours prior to WELCHOL [See Drug Interactions (7)]. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Bowel obstruction (in patients with a history of bowel obstruction or resection), dysphagia or esophageal obstruction (occasionally requiring medical intervention), fecal impaction, pancreatitis, abdominal distension, exacerbation of hemorrhoids, and increased transaminases.

The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. Obsessive compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of fluvoxamine maleate tablets was established in three trials in outpatients with OCD: two 10 week trials in adults, and one 10 week trial in pediatric patients (ages 8 to 17) (see CLINICAL STUDIES [14]).","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Suicidality: Monitor for clinical worsening and suicide risk (5.1). Bipolar disorder: Screen for bipolar disorder (5.1). Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions: Serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions have been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs. Discontinue fluvoxamine maleate tablets and initiate supportive treatment (5.3). Other potentially important drug interactions. Benzodiazepines: Use with caution. Coadministration with diazepam is generally not advisable (5.8). Clozapine: Clozapine levels may be increased and produce orthostatic hypotension or seizures (5.8). Methadone: Coadministration may produce opioid intoxication. Discontinuation of fluvoxamine may produce opioid withdrawal (5.8). Mexiletine: Monitor serum mexiletine levels (5.8). Ramelteon: Should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine (5.8). Theophylline: Clearance decreased; reduce theophylline dose by one-third (5.8). Warfarin: Plasma concentrations increased and prothrombin times prolonged; monitor prothrombin time and adjust warfarin dose accordingly (5.8). Other Drugs Affecting Hemostasis: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs affecting coagulation (5.8, 5.10). See Contraindications (4). Discontinuation: Symptoms associated with discontinuation have been reported (5.9). Abrupt discontinuation not recommended. See Dosage And Administration (2.7). Activation of mania/hypomania has occurred (5.11). Seizures: Avoid administering fluvoxamine in patients with unstable epilepsy; monitor patients with controlled epilepsy; discontinue treatment if seizures occur or frequency increases (5.12). Hyponatremia: May occur with SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets. The elderly may be at increased risk. Consider discontinuing in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia (5.13). Concomitant illness: Use caution in patients with diseases or conditions that affect hemodynamic responses or metabolism (5.14). Patients with impaired liver function may require a lower starting dose and slower titration (2.3). 5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1: DRUG-PLACEBO DIFFERENCES IN NUMBER OF CASES OF SUICIDALITY PER 1000 PATIENTS TREATED Age Range Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 14 ADDITIONAL CASES 18 to 24 5 ADDITIONAL CASES Age Range Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 FEWER CASE 65 6 FEWER CASES No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about the drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Discontinuation of Treatment With Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets [5.9], for a description of the risks of discontinuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets). Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that fluvoxamine maleate tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. 5.2 Potential for Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Interaction In patients receiving another serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have discontinued that drug and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling a serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping fluvoxamine maleate tablets before starting an MAOI (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.5] and CONTRAINDICATIONS [4]). 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including fluvoxamine maleate tablet treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms. The concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated. If concomitant treatment of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. The concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended. Treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. 5.4 Potential Thioridazine Interaction The effect of fluvoxamine (25 mg b.i.d. for one week) on thioridazine steady-state concentrations was evaluated in 10 male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased threefold following coadministration of fluvoxamine. Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. It is likely that this experience underestimates the degree of risk that might occur with higher doses of thioridazine. Moreover, the effect of fluvoxamine may be even more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses. Therefore, fluvoxamine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4]). 5.5 Potential Tizanidine Interaction Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and tizanidine is a CYP1A2 substrate. The effect of fluvoxamine (100 mg daily for 4 days) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine has been studied in 10 healthy male subjects. Tizanidine Cmax was increased approximately 12 fold (range 5 fold to 32 fold), elimination half-life was increased by almost 3 fold, and AUC increased 33 fold (range 14 fold to 103 fold). The mean maximal effect on blood pressure was a 35 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, a 20 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, and a 4 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Drowsiness was significantly increased and performance on the psychomotor task was significantly impaired. Fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be used together (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4]). 5.6 Potential Pimozide Interaction Pimozide is metabolized by the cytochrome P4503A4 isoenzyme, and it has been demonstrated that ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, blocks the metabolism of this drug, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug. An increased plasma concentration of pimozide causes QT prolongation and has been associated with torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, sometimes fatal. As noted below, a substantial pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed for fluvoxamine in combination with alprazolam, a drug that is known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that fluvoxamine is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, it is likely to be, given the substantial interaction of fluvoxamine with alprazolam. Consequently, it is recommended that fluvoxamine not be used in combination with pimozide (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4]). 5.7 Potential Alosetron Interaction Because alosetron is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron. Fluvoxamine is a known potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and also inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 mg to 200 mg a day for 16 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentration (AUC) approximately 6 fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3 fold (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4] and Lotronex (alosetron) package insert). 5.8 Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, etc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by fluvoxamine. The clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) is unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine. Alprazolam - When fluvoxamine maleate (100 mg q.d.) and alprazolam (1 mg q.i.d.) were coadministered to steady state, plasma concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, T) of alprazolam were approximately twice those observed when alprazolam was administered alone; oral clearance was reduced by about 50%. The elevated plasma alprazolam concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory. This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is coadministered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100 to 300 mg. If alprazolam is coadministered with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Diazepam - The coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable. Because fluvoxamine reduces the clearance of both diazepam and its active metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic coadministration. Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to coadminister fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam. In these subjects (N = 8), the clearance of diazepam was reduced by 65% and that of N-desmethyldiazepam to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study. It is likely that this experience significantly underestimates the degree of accumulation that might occur with repeated diazepam administration. Moreover, as noted with alprazolam, the effect of fluvoxamine may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses. Accordingly, diazepam and fluvoxamine should not ordinarily be coadministered. Clozapine - Elevated serum levels of clozapine have been reported in patients taking fluvoxamine maleate and clozapine. Since clozapine-related seizures and orthostatic hypotension appear to be dose related, the risk of these adverse events may be higher when fluvoxamine and clozapine are coadministered. Patients should be closely monitored when fluvoxamine maleate and clozapine are used concurrently. Methadone - Significantly increased methadone (plasma level:dose) ratios have been reported when fluvoxamine maleate was administered to patients receiving maintenance methadone treatment, with symptoms of opioid intoxication in one patient. Opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported following fluvoxamine maleate discontinuation in another patient. Mexiletine: The effect of steady-state fluvoxamine (50 mg b.i.d. for 7 days) on the single dose pharmacokinetics of mexiletine (200 mg) was evaluated in 6 healthy Japanese males. The clearance of mexiletine was reduced by 38% following coadministration with fluvoxamine compared to mexiletine alone. If fluvoxamine and mexiletine are coadministered, serum mexiletine levels should be monitored. Ramelteon: When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for 3 days prior to single-dose coadministration of ramelteon 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC for ramelteon increased approximately 190 fold and the Cmax increased approximately 70 fold compared to ramelteon administered alone. Ramelteon should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. Theophylline: The effect of steady-state fluvoxamine (50 mg bid) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of theophylline (375 mg as 442 mg aminophylline) was evaluated in 12 healthy non-smoking, male volunteers. The clearance of theophylline was decreased approximately 3 fold. Therefore, if theophylline is coadministered with fluvoxamine maleate, its dose should be reduced to one-third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of theophylline should be monitored. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Warfarin and Other Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, etc.): Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Thus, patients should be cautioned about the use of such drugs concurrently with fluvoxamine (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Abnormal Bleeding [5.10]). Warfarin - When fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg t.i.d.) was administered concomitantly with warfarin for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged. Thus patients receiving oral anticoagulants and fluvoxamine maleate tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. 5.9 Discontinuation of Treatment With Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets During marketing of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias, such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.7]). 5.10 Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see section 5.8]. 5.11 Activation of Mania/Hypomania During premarketing studies involving primarily depressed patients, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with fluvoxamine. In a ten week pediatric OCD study, 2 out of 57 patients (4%) treated with fluvoxamine experienced manic reactions, compared to none of 63 placebo patients. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. 5.12 Seizures During premarketing studies, seizures were reported in 0.2% of fluvoxamine-treated patients. Caution is recommended when the drug is administered to patients with a history of convulsive disorders. Fluvoxamine should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy and patients with controlled epilepsy should be carefully monitored. Treatment with fluvoxamine should be discontinued if seizures occur or if seizure frequency increases. 5.13 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Ge riatric Use [8.5]). Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.14 Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness Closely monitored clinical experience with fluvoxamine maleate tablets in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advised in administering fluvoxamine maleate tablets to patients with diseases or conditions that could affect hemodynamic responses or metabolism. Fluvoxamine maleate tablets have not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were systematically excluded from many clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. Evaluation of the electrocardiograms for patients with depression or OCD who participated in premarketing studies revealed no differences between fluvoxamine and placebo in the emergence of clinically important ECG changes. Patients with Hepatic Impairment - In patients with liver dysfunction, fluvoxamine clearance was decreased by approximately 30%. Patients with liver dysfunction should begin with a low dose of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and increase it slowly with careful monitoring. 5.15 Laboratory Tests There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Coadministration of tizanidine, thioridazine, alosetron, or pimozide with fluvoxamine maleate tablets is contraindicated (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.4 to 5.7]).

Using the above rule, the following events were also identified: anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, and urinary frequency in patients with OCD; and agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, and rash in pediatric patients with OCD. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevausa.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation Of the 1087 OCD and depressed patients treated with fluvoxamine maleate in controlled clinical trials in North America, 22% discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in at least 2% of fluvoxamine maleate-treated patients in these trials were: nausea (9%), insomnia (4%), somnolence (4%), headache (3%), and asthenia, vomiting, nervousness, agitation, and dizziness (2% each). 6.2 Incidence in Controlled Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials: Fluvoxamine maleate tablets have been studied in 10 week short-term controlled trials of OCD (N = 320) and depression (N = 1350). In general, adverse reaction rates were similar in the two data sets as well as in the pediatric OCD study. The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and likely to be drug-related (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) derived from Table 2 were: nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, and vomiting. In a pool of two studies involving only patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, and urinary frequency. In a study of pediatric patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, and rash. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1%: Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in adults at a frequency of 1% or more, and were more frequent than in the placebo group, among patients treated with fluvoxamine maleate tablets in two short-term placebo controlled OCD trials (10 week) and depression trials (6 week) in which patients were dosed in a range of generally 100 to 300 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one occurrence of a reaction at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse reactions were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied.

Additionally, there was an approximate 25% decrease in nausea. The reactions in OCD studies with a two-fold increase in rate compared to reaction rates in OCD and depression studies were: asthenia, abnormal ejaculation (mostly delayed ejaculation), anxiety, rhinitis, anorgasmia (in males), depression, libido decreased, pharyngitis, agitation, impotence, myoclonus/twitch, thirst, weight loss, leg cramps, myalgia, and urinary retention. These reactions are listed in order of decreasing rates in the OCD trials. 6.3 Other Adverse Reactions in OCD Pediatric Population In pediatric patients (N = 57) treated with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in Table 2. However, the following adverse reactions, not appearing in Table 2, were reported in two or more of the pediatric patients and were more frequent with fluvoxamine maleate tablets than with placebo: cough increase, dysmenorrhea, ecchymosis, emotional lability, epistaxis, hyperkinesia, manic reaction, rash, sinusitis, and weight decrease. 6.4 Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction With SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder and with aging, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. Table 3 displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets in placebo-controlled trials in depression and OCD. Table 3: PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS REPORTING SEXUAL ADVERSE REACTIONS IN ADULT PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS IN OCD AND DEPRESSION Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets N = 892 Placebo N = 778 Abnormal EjaculationBased on the number of male patients. 8% 1% Impotence 2% 1% Decreased Libido 2% 1% Anorgasmia 2% 0% There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with fluvoxamine treatment. Fluvoxamine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae and upon discontinuation of fluvoxamine. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. 6.5 Vital Sign Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on (1) median change from baseline on various vital signs variables and on (2) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various vital signs variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate and placebo. 6.6 Laboratory Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on (1) median change from baseline on various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables and on (2) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate and placebo. 6.7 ECG Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on (1) mean change from baseline on various ECG variables and on (2) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various ECG variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate and placebo. 6.8 Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets During premarketing clinical trials conducted in North America and Europe, multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate were administered for a combined total of 2737 patient exposures in patients suffering OCD or Major Depressive Disorder. Untoward reactions associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of untoward reactions into a limited (i.e., reduced) number of standard reaction categories. In the tabulations which follow, a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. If the COSTART term for a reaction was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2737 patient exposures to multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate who experienced a reaction of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving fluvoxamine maleate. All reported reactions are included in the list below, with the following exceptions: 1) those reactions already listed in Table 2, which tabulates incidence rates of common adverse experiences in placebo-controlled OCD and depression clinical trials, are excluded; 2) those reactions for which a drug cause was not considered likely are omitted; 3) reactions for which the COSTART term was too vague to be clinically meaningful and could not be replaced with a more informative term; and 4) reactions which were reported in only one patient and judged to not be potentially serious are not included. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported did occur during treatment with fluvoxamine maleate, a causal relationship to fluvoxamine maleate has not been established. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring between 1/100 and 1/1000 patients; and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent: malaise; Infrequent: photosensitivity reaction and suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Frequent: syncope. Digestive System Infrequent: gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena; Rare: hematemesis. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems Infrequent: anemia and ecchymosis; Rare: purpura. Metabolic and Nutritional Systems Frequent: weight gain and weight loss. Nervous System Frequent: hyperkinesia, manic reaction, and myoclonus; Infrequent: abnormal dreams, akathisia, convulsion, dyskinesia, dystonia, euphoria, extrapyramidal syndrome, and twitching; Rare: withdrawal syndrome. Respiratory System Infrequent: epistaxis. Rare: hemoptysis and laryngismus. Skin Infrequent: urticaria. Urogenital System * Infrequent: hematuria, menorrhagia, and vaginal hemorrhage; Rare: hematospermia. * Based on the number of males or females, as appropriate. 6.9 Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of adverse reactions in patients taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to fluvoxamine maleate tablets use include: acute renal failure, agranulocytosis, amenorrhea, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, aplastic anemia, bullous eruption, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, hepatitis, ileus, pancreatitis, porphyria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, and ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes).","drugClass":"fluvoxamine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults: Recommended starting dose is 50 mg at bedtime, with increases of 50 mg every 4 to 7 days as tolerated to maximum effect, not to exceed 300 mg/day. Daily doses over 100 mg should be divided (2.1). Children and adolescents (8 to 17 years): Recommended starting dose is 25 mg at bedtime, with increases of 25 mg every 4 to 7 days as tolerated to maximum effect, not to exceed 200 mg/day (8 to 11 years) or 300 mg/day (12 to 17 years). Daily doses over 50 mg should be divided (2.2). Hepatically impaired: Decreased clearance may require modified dose and titration (2.3). Discontinuation: Gradual dose reduction is recommended (2.7, see Warnings and Precautions [5.9]). 2.1 Adults The recommended starting dose for fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in adult patients is 50 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime. In the controlled clinical trials establishing the effectiveness of fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in OCD, patients were titrated within a dose range of 100 to 300 mg/day. Consequently, the dose should be increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 300 mg per day. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 100 mg should be given in two divided doses. If the doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime. 2.2 Pediatric Population (Children and Adolescents) The recommended starting dose for fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in pediatric populations (ages 8 to 17 years) is 25 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime. In a controlled clinical trial establishing the effectiveness of fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in OCD, pediatric patients (ages 8 to 17) were titrated within a dose range of 50 to 200 mg/day. Physicians should consider age and gender differences when dosing pediatric patients. The maximum dose in children up to age 11 should not exceed 200 mg/day. Therapeutic effect in female children may be achieved with lower doses. Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit. The dose should be increased in 25 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 50 mg should be given in two divided doses. If the two divided doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime. 2.3 Elderly or Hepatically Impaired Patients Elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment have been observed to have a decreased clearance of fluvoxamine maleate. Consequently, it may be appropriate to modify the initial dose and the subsequent dose titration for these patient groups. 2.4 Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester Neonates exposed to fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding and may be at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS [8.1]). When treating pregnant women with fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in the third trimester. 2.5 Switching Patients to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of therapy with fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP before starting an MAOI. 2.7 Discontinuation of Treatment With Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets USP Symptoms associated with discontinuation of other SSRIs or SNRIs have been reported (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.9]). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.","activeIngredient":3059434},{"uuid":"50090-1127","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Bystolic","proprietaryName":"A-S Medication Solutions","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE BYSTOLIC is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1.1) 1.1 Hypertension BYSTOLIC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. BYSTOLIC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with BYSTOLIC. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.","warning":"5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue (5.1) Diabetes: Monitor glucose as -blockers may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia (5.5) 5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy Do not abruptly discontinue BYSTOLIC therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with -blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Caution patients without overt coronary artery disease against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other -blockers, when discontinuation of BYSTOLIC is planned, carefully observe and advise patients to minimize physical activity. Taper BYSTOLIC over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, re-start BYSTOLIC promptly, at least temporarily. 5.2 Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction BYSTOLIC was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent MI. 5.3 Bronchospastic Diseases In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive -blockers. 5.4 Anesthesia and Major Surgery Because beta-blocker withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of MI and chest pain, patients already on beta-blockers should generally continue treatment throughout the perioperative period. If BYSTOLIC is to be continued perioperatively, monitor patients closely when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If -blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The -blocking effects of BYSTOLIC can be reversed by -agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with -blockers. 5.5 Diabetes and Hypoglycemia -blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective -blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Advise patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia and diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents about these possibilities. 5.6 Thyrotoxicosis -blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of -blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.7 Peripheral Vascular Disease -blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 5.8 Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with -blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, monitor the ECG and blood pressure in patients treated concomitantly with these agents. 5.9 Use with CYP2D6 Inhibitors Nebivolol exposure increases with inhibition of CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The dose of BYSTOLIC may need to be reduced. 5.10 Impaired Renal Function Renal clearance of nebivolol is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. BYSTOLIC has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.11 Impaired Hepatic Function Metabolism of nebivolol is decreased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. BYSTOLIC has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.12 Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions While taking -blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. 5.13 Pheochromocytoma In patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma, initiate an -blocker prior to the use of any -blocker.","contraindication":"4.

The observed adverse reaction profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients in the clinical trials. Adverse reactions reported for each of these patient populations are provided below. Excluded are adverse reactions considered too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. The data described below reflect worldwide clinical trial exposure to BYSTOLIC in 6545 patients, including 5038 patients treated for hypertension and the remaining 1507 subjects treated for other cardiovascular diseases. Doses ranged from 0.5 mg to 40 mg. Patients received BYSTOLIC for up to 24 months, with over 1900 patients treated for at least 6 months, and approximately 1300 patients for more than one year. HYPERTENSION: In placebo-controlled clinical trials comparing BYSTOLIC with placebo, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was reported in 2.8% of patients treated with nebivolol and 2.2% of patients given placebo. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of BYSTOLIC were headache (0.4%), nausea (0.2%) and bradycardia (0.2%). Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that were reported in three 12-week, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving 1597 hypertensive patients treated with either 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20-40 mg of BYSTOLIC and 205 patients given placebo and for which the rate of occurrence was at least 1% of patients treated with nebivolol and greater than the rate for those treated with placebo in at least one dose group.

For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial. Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL/min) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the -blocker class to which nebivolol principally belongs and the ARB class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with BYVALSON. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. BYVALSON may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. BYVALSON is a beta adrenergic blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue. (5.3) Diabetes: Monitor glucose as -blockers may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia. (5.7) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. (5.11) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Valsartan Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue BYVALSON as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those receiving high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving BYVALSON. Correct these conditions prior to administration of BYVALSON, or start the treatment under close medical supervision. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy Nebivolol Do not abruptly discontinue BYVALSON in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with -blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other -blocker therapies, when discontinuation of BYVALSON is planned, carefully observe and advise patients to minimize physical activity. Taper nebivolol using monotherapy over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens re-start nebivolol promptly, at least temporarily. 5.4 Cardiac Failure Nebivolol Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during nebivolol therapy because of its -blocking effects. Consider diuretic therapy and treat heart failure appropriately, according to current guidelines. 5.5 Bronchospastic Diseases Nebivolol In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive -blockers. 5.6 Anesthesia and Major Surgery Nebivolol Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. Monitor patients closely when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. 5.7 Diabetes and Hypoglycemia Nebivolol -blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective -blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Advise patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia and diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents about these possibilities. 5.8 Thyrotoxicosis Nebivolol -blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of -blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Peripheral Vascular Disease Nebivolol -blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 5.10 Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers Nebivolol Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with -blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, monitor heart rate and blood pressure in patients treated concomitantly with these agents. 5.11 Impaired Renal Function Valsartan Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g. patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.12 Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions Nebivolol While taking -blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. 5.13 Pheochromocytoma Nebivolol In patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma, initiate a -blocker prior to the use of any -blocker. 5.14 Hyperkalemia Valsartan In hypertensive patients, greater than 20% increases in serum potassium were observed in 4.4% of valsartan-treated patients compared to 2.9% of placebo-treated patients.

BYVALSON BYVALSON has been evaluated for safety in patients with hypertension. A total of 1,664 patients received at least 1 dose of a fixed-dose combination of nebivolol/valsartan in an 8-week trial. A total of 807 patients received at least 1 dose of nebivolol and valsartan in an open-label safety study; of these, 621 patients completed 180 days and 476 patients completed 360 days of open-label treatment with nebivolol and valsartan. The safety of the 5 mg/ 80 mg dose of nebivolol/valsartan was evaluated during the first 4 weeks of an 8-week placebo-controlled trial. During the 4 week period, the overall incidence of adverse events on therapy with BYVALSON 5 mg/ 80 mg was similar to placebo and the individual components (nebivolol 5 mg and valsartan 80 mg). Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event occurred in 2.0% of patients treated with BYVALSON 5 mg/ 80 mg versus 3.2% of patients given placebo and approximately 1% of patients given nebivolol 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg as monotherapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of either nebivolol or valsartan.

These adverse reactions were in most cases observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies. Body as a Whole : asthenia. Gastrointestinal System Disorders : abdominal pain Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : hypercholesterolemia Nervous System Disorders : paraesthesia 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled monotherapy trials of hypertensive patients, nebivolol was associated with an increase in BUN, uric acid, triglycerides and a decrease in HDL cholesterol and platelet count. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of nebivolol tablets received worldwide and have not been listed elsewhere. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting or potential causal connection to Nebivolol. Adverse reactions common in the population have generally been omitted. Because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to nebivolol exposure: abnormal hepatic function (including increased AST, ALT and bilirubin), acute pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, atrioventricular block (both second and third degree), bronchospasm, erectile dysfunction, hypersensitivity (including urticaria, allergic vasculitis and rare reports of angioedema), myocardial infarction, pruritus, psoriasis, Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral ischemia/claudication, somnolence, syncope, thrombocytopenia, various rashes and skin disorders, vertigo, and vomiting.","drugClass":"nebivolol","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Can be taken with and without food.

For infants and children, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight. Hormone therapy is an adjunct to and not a replacement for conventional therapy. Dosage should be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. The severity, prognosis, expected duration of the disease, and the reaction of the patient to medication are primary factors in determining dosage. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including two-hour postprandial blood glucose and serum potassium, and a chest X-ray should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease. The initial dosage of prednisolone oral solution may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisolone oral solution should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisolone oral solution for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.","activeIngredient":3058453},{"uuid":"68083-176","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Oxaliplatin","proprietaryName":"Gland Pharma Limited","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Oxaliplatin Injection, USP used in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, is indicated for: adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in patients who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor. treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.

Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.8, 8.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to Oxaliplatin Injection, USP has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Drug-related deaths associated withplatinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin Injection, USP is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to coldtemperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia andhypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation,dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversiblepattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection, USPwith 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed inapproximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheralsensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administeredon the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias , hypoesthesias , but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receivingOxaliplatin Injection, USP with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acuteneuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathyprogressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upondiscontinuation of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias /Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (<0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41 to 44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Delay Oxaliplatin Injection, USP until neutrophils are 1.5 x 109/L. Withhold Oxaliplatin Injection, USP for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce Oxaliplatin Injection, USP after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [s ee D o s age and A d m i n i s t r a ti on ( 2.2 ) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin Injection, USP has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, Oxaliplatin Injection, USP should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [s ee C li n i c al T r i a ls E x p e r i e n ce ( 6. 1 ) ]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following Oxaliplatin Injection, USP administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. Discontinue Oxaliplatin Injection, USP if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin Injection, USP may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. [s ee U se in Sp ec ific P opu l a ti ons ( 8. 1 ) ]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each Oxaliplatin Injection, USP cycle [s ee D o s age and A d m i n i s t r a ti on ( 2 ) ]. There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxaliplatin Injection, USP should not be administered to patients with a history of known allergy to Oxaliplatin Injection, USP or other platinum compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [s ee W a r n i ngs and P r ec au ti ons ( 5 ) ]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [s ee C li n i c al S t ud i es ( 14 ) ]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection, USP is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture.

The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [s ee C li n i c al S t ud i es ( 14 ) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences 1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in 2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [s ee C li n i c al S t ud i es ( 14 ) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences 1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin Injection, USP arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin Injection, USP did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin Injection, USP combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in 5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: Deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: Laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)","drugClass":"oxaliplatin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Oxaliplatin Injection, USP should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Administer Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in combination with 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin every 2 weeks. (2.1): Day 1: Oxaliplatin Injection, USP 85 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 250 to 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP both given over 120 minutes at the same time in separate bags using a Y-line, followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes, followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. Day 2: leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 120 minutes, followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes , followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. Reduce the dose of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP to 75 mg/m2 (adjuvant setting) or 65 mg/m2 (advanced colorectal cancer) (2.2): if there are persistent grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve. after recovery from grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicities (despite prophylactic treatment) or grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia or grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Delay next dose until neutrophils 1.5 109/L and platelets 75 109/L. For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the initial recommended dose is 65 mg/m2. (2.2) Discontinue Oxaliplatin Injection, USP if there are persistent Grade 3 neurosensory events. (2.2) Never prepare a final dilution with a sodium chloride solution or other chloride -containing solutions. (2.3) 2.1 Dosage Administer Oxaliplatin Injection, USP in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin every 2 weeks. For advanced disease, treatment is recommended until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For adjuvant use, treatment is recommended for a total of 6 months (12 cycles): Day 1: Oxaliplatin Injection, USP 85 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 250 to 500 mL 5% Dextrose injection, USP and leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP both given over 120 minutes at the same time in separate bags using a Y-line, followed by 5- fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes, followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. Day 2: Leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 120 minutes, followed by 5- fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes, followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. The administration of Oxaliplatin Injection, USP does not require prehydration. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers with or without dexamethasone, is recommended. For information on 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, see the respective package inserts. 2.2 Dose Modification Recommendations Prior to subsequent therapy cycles, patients should be evaluated for clinical toxicities and recommended laboratory tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Prolongation of infusion time for Oxaliplatin Injection, USP from 2 hours to 6 hours may mitigate acute toxicities. The infusion times for 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin do not need to be changed. Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Stage III Colon Cancer Neuropathy and other toxicities were graded using the NCI CTC scale version 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

General Adverse event information is derived from controlled clinical trials and worldwide marketing experience. In the description below, rates of the more common events represent US/Canadian clinical study results. Less frequent events are also derived from publications and marketing experience in over 8 million patients; there are insufficient data to support an accurate estimate of their incidence rates. These studies were conducted using a variety of premedicants, varying lengths of surgical/diagnostic procedures, and various other anesthetic/sedative agents. Most adverse events were mild and transient. Anesthesia and MAC Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events for propofol injectable emulsion include data from clinical trials in general anesthesia/MAC sedation (N=2,889 adult patients). The adverse events listed below as probably causally related are those events in which the actual incidence rate in patients treated with propofol injectable emulsion was greater than the comparator incidence rate in these trials. Therefore, incidence rates for anesthesia and MAC sedation in adults generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have probable causal relationship. The adverse experience profile from reports of 150 patients in the MAC sedation clinical trials is similar to the profile established with propofol during anesthesia (see below). During MAC sedation clinical trials, significant respiratory events included cough, upper airway obstruction, apnea, hypoventilation, and dyspnea. Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients Generally the adverse experience profile from reports of 506 propofol injectable emulsion pediatric patients from 6 days through 16 years of age in the US/Canadian anesthesia clinical trials is similar to the profile established with propofol injectable emulsion during anesthesia in adults (see Pediatric percentages [Peds %] below). Although not reported as an adverse event in clinical trials, apnea is frequently observed in pediatric patients. ICU Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events include data from clinical trials in ICU sedation (N=159 adult patients). Probably related incidence rates for ICU sedation were determined by individual case report form review. Probable causality was based upon an apparent dose response relationship and/or positive responses to rechallenge. In many instances the presence of concomitant disease and concomitant therapy made the causal relationship unknown. Therefore, incidence rates for ICU sedation generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have a probable causal relationship.

Propofol blood concentrations at steady-state are generally proportional to infusion rates, especially in individual patients. Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3 minutes to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects. Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. When administering propofol injectable emulsion by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing propofol injectable emulsion to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical. Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of propofol injectable emulsion. For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate propofol injectable emulsion infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of propofol injectable emulsion and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia until a mild response to surgical stimulation is obtained in order to avoid administration of propofol injectable emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., sedatives, anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. Induction of General Anesthesia Adult Patients Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg of propofol injectable emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. For induction, propofol injectable emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. As with other general anesthetics, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of propofol injectable emulsion. Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of propofol injectable emulsion before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of propofol injectable emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pediatric Patients Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 mg/kg to 3.5 mg/kg of propofol injectable emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other general anesthetics, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of propofol injectable emulsion. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering propofol injectable emulsion to pediatric patients. Boluses of propofol injectable emulsion may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Neurosurgical Patients Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of propofol injectable emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg) (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Cardiac Anesthesia Propofol injectable emulsion has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other general anesthetics and sedation drugs, propofol injectable emulsion in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates. In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with propofol injectable emulsion, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated. As with other anesthetic agents, propofol injectable emulsion reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injectable emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of propofol injectable emulsion administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses. A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when propofol injectable emulsion is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100 mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, propofol injectable emulsion maintenance rates should not be less than 50 mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of propofol injectable emulsion will reduce the opioid requirements (see TABLE 4 ). When propofol injectable emulsion is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Anesthesia ). TABLE 4. Cardiac Anesthesia Techniques Primary Agent Rate Secondary Agent/Rate (Following Induction with Primary Agent) Propofol Injectable Emulsion OPIOIDOPIOID is defined in terms of fentanyl equivalents, i.e., 1 mcg of fentanyl = 5 mcg of alfentanil (for bolus) = 10 mcg of alfentanil (for maintenance) OR = 0.1 mcg of sufentanil/0.05 mcg/kg/min to 0.075 mcg/kg/min (no bolus) Preinduction Anxiolysis 25 mcg/kg/min Induction 0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg Over 60 sec Maintenance (Titrated to Clinical Response) 100 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min OPIOIDCare should be taken to ensure amnesia. Propofol Injectable Emulsion /50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min (no bolus) Induction 25 mcg/kg to 50 mcg/kg Maintenance 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.3 mcg/kg/min Maintenance of General Anesthesia Propofol injectable emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Adult Patients In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering propofol injectable emulsion by infusion or intermittent IV bolus injection. The patient's clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections. Continuous Infusion Propofol injectable emulsion 100 mcg/kg/min to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of propofol injectable emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 mcg/kg/min to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., sedatives, anesthetics, and opioids) can increase the CNS depression induced by propofol. Intermittent Bolus Increments of propofol injectable emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery. The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. Pediatric Patients Propofol injectable emulsion administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia. In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of propofol injectable emulsion at a rate of 200 mcg/kg/min to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half-hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. Propofol injectable emulsion should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients (see TABLE 2 Clinical Trials). Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation Adult Patients When propofol injectable emulsion is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of propofol injectable emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS ). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Initiation of MAC Sedation For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing propofol injectable emulsion at 100 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 mg/kg/h to 9 mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When propofol injectable emulsion is administered slowly over 3 minutes to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS ). The rate of administration should be over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and the dosage of propofol injectable emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Maintenance of MAC Sedation For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 mg/kg/h to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 minutes to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of propofol injectable emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of propofol injectable emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS ). The rate of administration and the dosage of propofol injectable emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Propofol injectable emulsion can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When propofol injectable emulsion sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of propofol injectable emulsion and may also result in a slower recovery profile (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). ICU Sedation (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Handling Procedures). Abrupt discontinuation of propofol injectable emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of propofol injectable emulsion should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (see PRECAUTIONS ). Adult Patients For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patient's underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see WARNINGS ). Propofol injectable emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see PRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation ). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Dosages of propofol injectable emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics. Conversely, the propofol injectable emulsion dosage requirement may also be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES ). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment of CNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of propofol required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation ). Bolus administration of 10 mg or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS ). SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES Dosages and rates of administration in the following table should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. Safety and dosing requirements for induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients have only been established for children 3 years of age or older. Safety and dosing requirements for the maintenance of anesthesia have only been established for children 2 months of age and older. For complete dosage information, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .

(see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatrics ) Maintenance of General Anesthesia: Intermittent Bolus Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: Increments of 20 mg to 50 mg as needed. Initiation of MAC Sedation Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: Slow infusion or slow injection techniques are recommended to avoid apnea or hypotension. Most patients require an infusion of 100 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 mg/kg/h to 9 mg/kg/h) for 3 minutes to 5 minutes or a slow injection of 0.5 mg/kg over 3 minutes to 5 minutes followed immediately by a maintenance infusion. Elderly, Debilitated, Neurosurgical, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients: Most patients require dosages similar to healthy adults. Rapid boluses are to be avoided (see WARNINGS ). Maintenance of MAC Sedation Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: A variable rate infusion technique is preferable over an intermittent bolus technique. Most patients require an infusion of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 mg/kg/h to 4.5 mg/kg/h) or incremental bolus doses of 10 mg or 20 mg. In Elderly, Debilitated, Neurosurgical, or ASA-PS III/IV Patients: Most patients require 80% of the usual adult dose. A rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose should not be used (see WARNINGS ). Initiation and Maintenance of ICU Sedation in Intubated, Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patients Because of the residual effects of previous anesthetic or sedative agents, in most patients the initial infusion should be 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h) for at least 5 minutes. Subsequent increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 0.6 mg/kg/h) over 5 minutes to 10 minutes may be used until desired clinical effect is achieved. Maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher may be required. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Evaluation of clinical effect and assessment of CNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of propofol injectable emulsion required for sedation. The tubing and any unused portions of propofol injectable emulsion should be discarded after 12 hours because propofol injectable emulsion contains no preservatives and is capable of supporting growth of microorganisms (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Administration with Lidocaine If lidocaine is to be administered to minimize pain on injection of propofol, it is recommended that it be administered prior to propofol administration or that it be added to propofol immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg propofol. Compatibility and Stability Propofol injectable emulsion should not be mixed with other therapeutic agents prior to administration. Dilution Prior to Administration Propofol injectable emulsion is provided as a ready-to-use formulation. However, should dilution be necessary, it should only be diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and it should not be diluted to a concentration less than 2 mg/mL because it is an emulsion. In diluted form it has been shown to be more stable when in contact with glass than with plastic (95% potency after 2 hours of running infusion in plastic). Administration with Other Fluids Compatibility of propofol injectable emulsion with the coadministration of blood/serum/plasma has not been established (see WARNINGS ). When administered using a y-type infusion set, propofol injectable emulsion has been shown to be compatible with the following intravenous fluids. 5% Dextrose Injection, USP Lactated Ringers Injection, USP Lactated Ringers and 5% Dextrose Injection 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Handling Procedures General Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Clinical experience with the use of in-line filters and propofol injectable emulsion during anesthesia or ICU/MAC sedation is limited. Propofol injectable emulsion should only be administered through a filter with a pore size of 5 micron or greater unless it has been demonstrated that the filter does not restrict the flow of propofol injectable emulsion and/or cause the breakdown of the emulsion. Filters should be used with caution and where clinically appropriate. Continuous monitoring is necessary due to the potential for restricted flow and/or breakdown of the emulsion. Do not use if there is evidence of separation of the phases of the emulsion. Rare cases of self-administration of propofol injectable emulsion, by health care professionals have been reported, including some fatalities (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling. Propofol injectable emulsion is a single access parenteral product (single patient infusion vial) which contains benzyl alcohol 1.5 mg/mL and sodium benzoate 0.7 mg/mL to inhibit the rate of growth of microorganisms, up to 12 hours, in the event of accidental extrinsic contamination. However, propofol injectable emulsion can still support the growth of microorganisms as it is not an antimicrobially preserved product under USP standards. Do not use if contamination is suspected. Discard unused drug product as directed within the required time limits. There have been reports in which failure to use aseptic technique when handling propofol injectable emulsion was associated with microbial contamination of the product and with fever, infection/sepsis, other life-threatening illness, and/or death. There have been reports, in the literature and other public sources, of the transmission of bloodborne pathogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV) from unsafe injection practices, and use of propofol vials intended for single use on multiple persons. Propofol injectable emulsion vials are never to be accessed more than once or used on more than one person. Propofol injectable emulsion, with benzyl alcohol, inhibits microbial growth for up to 12 hours, as demonstrated by test data for representative USP microorganisms. Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for General Anesthesia/MAC Sedation Propofol must be prepared for use just prior to initiation of each individual anesthetic/sedative procedure. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Propofol should be drawn into a sterile syringe immediately after a vial is opened. When withdrawing propofol from vials, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe should be labeled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been opened. Propofol injectable emulsion must be prepared for single-patient use only. Any unused portions of propofol injectable emulsion drug product, reservoirs, dedicated administration tubing and/or solutions containing propofol injectable emulsion must be discarded at the end of the anesthetic procedure or at 12 hours, whichever occurs sooner. The IV line should be flushed every 12 hours and at the end of the anesthetic procedure to remove residual propofol injectable emulsion. Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for ICU Sedation Propofol injectable emulsion must be prepared for single-patient use only. Strict aseptic techniques must be followed. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. A sterile vent spike and sterile tubing must be used for administration of propofol injectable emulsion. As with other lipid emulsions, the number of IV line manipulations should be minimized. Administration should commence promptly and must be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been spiked. The tubing and any unused propofol injectable emulsion drug product must be discarded after 12 hours. If propofol injectable emulsion is transferred to a syringe prior to administration, it should be drawn into a sterile syringe immediately after a vial is opened. When withdrawing propofol injectable emulsion from a vial, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe should be labeled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been opened. Propofol injectable emulsion should be discarded and administration lines changed after 12 hours.","activeIngredient":3058778},{"uuid":"49836-023","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Anesthesia S/I-50","proprietaryName":"RX PHARMA-PACK, INC.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is an IV sedative-hypnotic agent that can be used as described in the table below.

DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is not recommended for induction of anesthesia below the age of 3 years or for maintenance of anesthesia below the age of 2 months because its safety and effectiveness have not been established in those populations. In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is not indicated for use in Pediatric ICU sedation since the safety of this regimen has not been established (seePRECAUTIONS,Pediatric Use ). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is not recommended for obstetrics, including Cesarean section deliveries. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion crosses the placenta, and as with other general anesthetic agents, the administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be associated with neonatal depression (seePRECAUTIONS). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is not recommended for use in nursing mothers because propofol has been reported to be excreted in human milk, and the effects of oral absorption of small amounts of propofol are not known (seePRECAUTIONS).","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to propofol or any ofDIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsioncomponents.

Shake well before use.","adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"propofol","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Propofol blood concentrations at steady-state are generally proportional to infusion rates, especially in individual patients. Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects. Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. When administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical. Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia until a mild response to surgical stimulation is obtained in order to avoid administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. Induction of General Anesthesia Adult Patients Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 to 2.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. For induction, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Patients Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to pediatric patients. Boluses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Neurosurgical Patients Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2mg/kg) (see PRECAUTIONSand DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Cardiac Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other anesthetic and sedative-hypnotic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates. In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated. As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses. A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance rates should not be less than 50mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion will reduce the opioid requirements (see Table 4). When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Anesthesia).

Maintenance of General Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Adult Patients In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion or intermittent IV bolus injection. The patient's clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections. Continuous Infusion DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase the CNS depression induced by propofol. Intermittent Bolus Increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery. The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. Pediatric Patients DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia. In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half-hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients. (See Table 2 Clinical Trials.) Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation Adult Patients When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Initiation of MAC Sedation For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at 100 to 150mcg/kg/min (6 to 9mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration should be over 3 to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Maintenance of MAC Sedation For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 to 15minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and may also result in a slower recovery profile (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). ICU Sedation (See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION,Handling Procedures. ) Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (see PRECAUTIONS). Adult Patients For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (seeWARNINGS). Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patients underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see WARNINGS). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see PRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation ). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (seeWARNINGS). Dosages of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics.The DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion dosage requirement may also be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment ofCNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU Sedation). Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS).","activeIngredient":3082478},{"uuid":"49836-024","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Anesthesia S/I-60","proprietaryName":"RX PHARMA-PACK, INC.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"Indications and Usage Stop use and ask a doctor if: Irritation or redness develops condition persists for more than 72 hours Cleansing of an injection site","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to propofol or any of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion components.

For induction, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia.

Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other sedativehypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to pediatric patients. Boluses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Neurosurgical Patients Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2 mg/kg) (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Cardiac Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other anesthetic and sedative-hypnotic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates. In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be determined based on the patients premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses. A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100 mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance rates should not be less than 50 mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion will reduce the opioid requirements (see Table 4). When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Anesthesia).

Maintenance of General Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Adult Patients In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion or intermittent IV bolus injection. The patients clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections. Continuous Infusion DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase the CNS depression induced by propofol. Intermittent Bolus Increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery. The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. Pediatric Patients DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia. In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half-hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients. (See Table 2 Clinical Trials.) Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation Adult Patients When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Initiation of MAC Sedation For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at 100 to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 to 9 mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration should be over 3 to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Maintenance of MAC Sedation For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50 mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and may also result in a slower recovery profile (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). ICU Sedation (See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Handling Procedures .) Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (see PRECAUTIONS). Adult Patients For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS). Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patients underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see WARNINGS). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be individualized according to the patients condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see PRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation ). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS). Dosages of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics. The DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion dosage requirement may also be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment of CNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation). Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS).","activeIngredient":3085037},{"uuid":"52584-269","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, EMULSION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Diprivan","proprietaryName":"General Injectables & Vaccines, Inc","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"Indications and Usage DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is an IV sedative-hypnotic agent that can be used as described in the table below.

In the description below, rates of the more common events represent US/Canadian clinical study results. Less frequent events are also derived from publications and marketing experience in over 8 million patients; there are insufficient data to support an accurate estimate of their incidence rates. These studies were conducted using a variety of premedicants, varying lengths of surgical/diagnostic procedures, and various other anesthetic/sedative agents. Most adverse events were mild and transient. Anesthesia and MAC Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events for DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion include data from clinical trials in general anesthesia/MAC sedation (N=2889 adult patients). The adverse events listed below as probably causally related are those events in which the actual incidence rate in patients treated with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion was greater than the comparator incidence rate in these trials. Therefore, incidence rates for anesthesia and MAC sedation in adults generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have probable causal relationship. The adverse experience profile from reports of 150 patients in the MAC sedation clinical trials is similar to the profile established with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion during anesthesia (see below). During MAC sedation clinical trials, significant respiratory events included cough, upper airway obstruction, apnea, hypoventilation, and dyspnea. Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients Generally the adverse experience profile from reports of 506 DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion pediatric patients from 6days through 16 years of age in the US/Canadian anesthesia clinical trials is similar to the profile established with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion during anesthesia in adults (see Pediatric percentages [Peds %] below). Although not reported as an adverse event in clinical trials, apnea is frequently observed in pediatric patients. ICU Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events include data from clinical trials in ICU sedation (N=159adultpatients). Probably related incidence rates for ICU sedation were determined by individual case report form review. Probable causality was based upon an apparent dose response relationship and/or positive responses to rechallenge. In many instances the presence of concomitant disease and concomitant therapy made the causal relationship unknown.

Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects. Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. When administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical. Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia until a mild response to surgical stimulation is obtained in order to avoid administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. Induction of General Anesthesia Adult Patients Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 to 2.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. For induction, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Patients Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other sedativehypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to pediatric patients. Boluses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Neurosurgical Patients Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2mg/kg) (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cardiac Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been wellstudied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other anesthetic and sedative-hypnotic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates. In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated. As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to nonnarcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses. A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance rates should not be less than 50mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion will reduce the opioid requirements (see Table 4). When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (seePRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Anesthesia).

Maintenance of General Anesthesia Adult Patients In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion or intermittent IV bolus injection. The patient's clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections. Continuous Infusion DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase the CNS depression induced by propofol. Intermittent Bolus Increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery. The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. Pediatric Patients DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia. In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half-hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients. (See Table 2 Clinical Trials.) DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation Adult Patients When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Initiation of MAC Sedation For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at 100 to 150mcg/kg/min (6 to 9mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration should be over 3 to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Maintenance of MAC Sedation For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 to 15minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS). The rate of administration and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and may also result in a slower recovery profile (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). ICU Sedation (See WARNINGS andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Handling Procedures) Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (see PRECAUTIONS). Adult Patients For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS). Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patients underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see WARNINGS). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see PRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS. Dosages of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics. Conversely, the DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion dosage requirement may be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDLINES). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment of cns function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS). SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES: Dosages and rates of administration in the following table should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. Safety and dosing requirements for induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients have only been established for children 3years of age or older. Safety and dosing requirements for the maintenance of anesthesia have only been established for children 2 months of age and older. For complete dosage information, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION INDICATION DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Induction of General Anethesia Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: 40 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (2 to 2.5 mg/kg). Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III of IV Patients: 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) Cardiac Anesthesia: 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg) Neurosurgical Patients: 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (1 to 2 mg/kg) Pediatric Patients-healthy, from 3 years to 16 years of age: 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg administered over 20 to 30 seconds. (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatrics) Maintenance of General Anesthesia Infusion Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min (6 to 12 mg/kg/h). Elderly, Debilitated, ASA-PS III or IV Patients: 50-100 mcg/kg/min (3 to 6 mg/kg/h). Cardiac Anesthesia: Most patients require: Primary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion with Secondary Opioid- 100 to 150 mcg/kg/min. Low-Dose DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion with Primary Opioid- 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 4) Neurosurgical Patients: 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min (6 to 12 mg/kg/h) Pediatric Patients-healthy, from 2 months of age to 16 years of age: 125 to 300 mcg/kg/min (7.5 to 18 mg/kg/h) Following the first half hour of maintenance, if clinical signs of light anesthesia are not present, the infusion rate should be decreased. (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatrics) Maintenance of General Anesthesia Intermittent Bolus Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: Increments of 20 to 50 mg as needed. Initiation of MAC Sedation Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years Of Age: Slow infusion or slow injection techniques are recommended to avoid apnea or hypotension. Most patients require an infusion of 100 to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 to 9 mg/kg/h) for 3 to 5 minutes or a slow injection of 0.5 mg/kg over 3 to 5 minutes followed immediately by a maintenance infusion. Elderly, Debilitate, Neurosurgical, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients: Most patients require dosages similar to healthy adults. Rapid boluses are to be avoided (see WARNINGS) Maintenance of MAC Sedation Healthy Adults Less Than 55 Years of Age: A variable rate infusin technique is preferable over an intermittent bolus technique. Most patients require and infusion of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/h) or incremental bolus doses of 10 mg or 20 mg. In Elderly, Debilitated, Neurosurgical, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients: Most patients require 80% of the usual adult dose. A rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose should not be used (see WARNINGS) Initiations and Maintenance of ICU Sedation in Intubated, Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patients- Because of the residual effects of previous anesthetic or sedative agents, in most patients the initial infusion should be 5 mdg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h) for at least 5 minutes. Subsequent increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) over 5 to 10 minutes may be used until desired clinical effect is achieved. Maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher may be required. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS). Evaluation of clinical effect and assessment of CNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion required for sedation. The tubing and any unused portions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be discarded after 12 hours because DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion contains no preservatives and is capable of supporting growth of microorganisms (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Administration with Lidocaine If lidocaine is to be administered to minimize pain on injection of DIPRIVAN, it is recommended that it be administered prior to DIPRIVAN administration or that it be added to DIPRIVAN immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg DIPRIVAN. Compatibility and Stability DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should not be mixed with other therapeutic agents prior to administration. Dilution Prior to Administration DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is provided as a ready-to-use formulation. However, should dilution be necessary, it should only be diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and it should not be diluted to a concentration less than 2 mg/mL because it is an emulsion. In diluted form it has been shown to be more stable when in contact with glass than with plastic (95%potency after 2hours of running infusion in plastic). Administration with Other Fluids Compatibility of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion with the coadministration of blood/serum/plasma has not been established (see WARNINGS). When administered using a y-type infusion set, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been shown to be compatible with the following intravenous fluids. - 5% Dextrose Injection, USP - Lactated Ringers Injection, USP - Lactated Ringers and 5% Dextrose Injection - 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP - 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Handling Procedures General Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Clinical experience with the use of in-line filters and DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion during anesthesia or ICU/MAC sedation is limited. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should only be administered through a filter with a pore size of 5 micron or greater unless it has been demonstrated that the filter does not restrict the flow of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and/or cause the breakdown of the emulsion. Filters should be used with caution and where clinically appropriate. Continuous monitoring is necessary due to the potential for restricted flow and/or breakdown of the emulsion. Do not use if there is evidence of separation of the phases of the emulsion. Rare cases of self-administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by health care professionals have been reported, including some fatalities (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDANCE). Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is a single-use parenteral product which contains 0.005% disodium edetate to inhibit the rate of growth of microogranisms, up to 12 hours, in the even of accidental extrinsic contamination. however, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can still support the growth of microorganisms as it is not an antimicrobially preserved product under USP standards. Accordingly, strict aseptic technique must still be adhered to. Do not use if contamination is suspected. Discard unused portions as directed within the required time limits (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Handling Procedures). There have been reports in which the failure to use aseptic technique when handling DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion was associated with microbial contamination of the product and with fever, infection/sepsis, other life-threatening illness, and/or death. Diprivan, with EDTA inhibits microbial growth for up to 12 hours, as demonstrated by test data for representative USP microorganisms. Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for General Anesthesia/MAC Sedation DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be prepared for use just prior to initiation of each individual anesthetic/sedative procedure. The vial syringe rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be drawn into sterile syringes immediately after vials are opened. When withdrawing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion from vials, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe(s) should be labeled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vials have been opened. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be prepared for singlepatient use only. Any unused portions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, reservoirs, dedicated administration tubing and/or solutions containing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion must be discarded at the end of the anesthetic procedure or at 12 hours, whichever occurs sooner. The IV line should be flushed every 12 hours and at the end of the anesthetic procedure to remove residual DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for ICU Sedation DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be prepared for single-patient use only. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered directly from the vial, strict aseptic techniques must be followed. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. A sterile vent spike and sterile tubing must be used for administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. As with other lipid emulsions, the number of IV line manipulations should be minimized. Administration should commence promptly and must be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been spiked. The tubing and any unused portions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion must be discarded after 12 hours. If DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is transferred to a syringe or other container prior to administration, the handling procedures for General anesthesia/MAC sedation should be followed, and the product should be discarded and administration lines changed after 12 hours.","activeIngredient":3085864},{"uuid":"49836-025","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Anesthesia S/I-40","proprietaryName":"RX PHARMA-PACK, INC.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"Uses Antiseptic cleanser Kills harmful bacteria and germs First aid to help prevent infection","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to propofol or any of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion components.

In the description below, rates of the more common events represent US/Canadian clinical study results. Less frequent events are also derived from publications and marketing experience in over 8 million patients; there are insufficient data to support an accurate estimate of their incidence rates. These studies were conducted using a variety of premedicants, varying lengths of surgical/diagnostic procedures, and various other anesthetic/sedative agents. Most adverse events were mild and transient. Anesthesia and MAC Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events for DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion include data from clinical trials in general anesthesia/MAC sedation (N=2889 adult patients). The adverse events listed below as probably causally related are those events in which the actual incidence rate in patients treated with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion was greater than the comparator incidence rate in these trials. Therefore, incidence rates for anesthesia and MAC sedation in adults generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have probable causal relationship. The adverse experience profile from reports of 150 patients in the MAC sedation clinical trials is similar to the profile established with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion during anesthesia (see below). During MAC sedation clinical trials, significant respiratory events included cough, upper airway obstruction, apnea, hypoventilation, and dyspnea. Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients Generally the adverse experience profile from reports of 506 DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion pediatric patients from 6 days through 16 years of age in the US/Canadian anesthesia clinical trials is similar to the profile established with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion during anesthesia in adults (see Pediatric percentages [Peds %] below). Although not reported as an adverse event in clinical trials, apnea is frequently observed in pediatric patients. ICU Sedation in Adults The following estimates of adverse events include data from clinical trials in ICU sedation (N=159 adult patients). Probably related incidence rates for ICU sedation were determined by individual case report form review. Probable causality was based upon an apparent dose response relationship and/or positive responses to rechallenge. In many instances the presence of concomitant disease and concomitant therapy made the causal relationship unknown. Therefore, incidence rates for ICU sedation generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have a probable causal relationship.

Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects. Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. When administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical. Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia until a mild response to surgical stimulation is obtained in order to avoid administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. Induction of General Anesthesia Adult Patients Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 to 2.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. For induction, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Patients Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion to pediatric patients. Boluses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (seePRECAUTIONS,General ). Neurosurgical Patients Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2 mg/kg) (seePRECAUTIONSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Cardiac Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other anesthetic and sedative-hypnotic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates. In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated. As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be determined based on the patients premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses. A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100 mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance rates should not be less than 50 mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion will reduce the opioid requirements (see Table 4). When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (seePRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Anesthesia).

Maintenance of General Anesthesia DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Adult Patients In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion by infusion or intermittent IV bolus injection. The patient's clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections. Continuous Infusion DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 100 to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times. Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase the CNS depression induced by propofol. Intermittent Bolus Increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery. The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. Pediatric Patients DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia. In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half-hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients. (See Table 2 Clinical Trials.) Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation Adult Patients When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (seeWARNINGS). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation. Initiation of MAC Sedation For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at 100 to 150mcg/kg/min (6 to 9mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion is administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (seeWARNINGS). The rate of administration should be over 3 to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Maintenance of MAC Sedation For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 to 15minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at rates higher than are clinically necessary. If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (seeWARNINGS). The rate of administration and the dosage of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and may also result in a slower recovery profile (seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). ICU Sedation (SeeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION,Handling Procedures) Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (seePRECAUTIONS). Adult Patients For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (seeDOSAGE ANDADMINISTRATION). Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (seeWARNINGS). Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patients underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (seeWARNINGS). DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (seePRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation ). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (seeWARNINGS). Dosages of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics.The DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion dosage requirement may also be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (seeSUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment ofCNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (seeClinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation). Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (seePRECAUTIONS).","activeIngredient":3116668},{"uuid":"54868-5701","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Methadone Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Physicians Total Care, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE For the treatment of moderate to severe pain not responsive to non-narcotic analgesics.

Tulsa, OK 74146","adverseReaction":"ADVERSE REACTIONS Heroin WithdrawalDuring the induction phase of methadone maintenance treatment, patients are being withdrawn from heroin and may therefore show typical withdrawal symptoms, which should be differentiated from methadone-induced side effects. They may exhibit some or all of the following signs and symptoms associated with acute withdrawal from heroin or other opiates: lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sneezing, yawning, excessive perspiration, goose-flesh, fever, chilliness alternating with flushing, restlessness, irritability, weakness, anxiety, depression, dilated pupils, tremors, tachycardia, abdominal cramps, body aches, involuntary twitching and kicking movements, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal spasms, and weight loss. Initial AdministrationThe initial methadone dose should be carefully titrated to the individual. Too rapid titration for the patient's sensitivity is more likely to produce adverse effects. The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Other adverse reactions include the following: Body as a Whole asthenia (weakness), edema, headache Cardiovascular arrhythmias, bigeminal rhythms, bradycardia, cardiomyopathy, ECG abnormalities, extrasystoles, flushing, heart failure, hypotension, palpitations, phlebitis, QT interval prolongation, syncope, T-wave inversion, tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia Digestive abdominal pain, anorexia, biliary tract spasm, constipation, dry mouth, glossitis Hematologic and Lymphatic reversible thrombocytopenia has been described in opioid addicts with chronic hepatitis Metabolic and Nutritional hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, weight gain Nervous agitation, confusion, disorientation, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, seizures Respiratory pulmonary edema, respiratory depression Skin and Appendages pruritis, urticaria, other skin rashes, and rarely, hemorrhagic urticaria Special Senses hallucinations, visual disturbances Urogenital amenorrhea, antidiuretic effect, reduced libido and/or potency, urinary retention or hesitancy Maintenance on a Stabilized Dose During prolonged administration of methadone, as in a methadone maintenance treatment program, there is usually a gradual, yet progressive, disappearance of side effects over a period of several weeks. However, constipation and sweating often persist.","drugClass":"methadone","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Methadone differs from many other opioid agonists in several important ways. Methadone's pharmacokinetic properties, coupled with high interpatient variability in its absorption, metabolism, and relative analgesic potency, necessitate a cautious and highly individualized approach to prescribing. Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dose titration. While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single-dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half-life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours). Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects. Also, with repeated dosing, methadone may be retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of action despite low plasma concentrations. For these reasons, steady-state plasma concentrations, and full analgesic effects, are usually not attained until 3 to 5 days of dosing. Additionally, incomplete cross-tolerance between mu-opioid agonists makes determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. The complexities associated with methadone dosing can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. A high degree of \"opioid tolerance\" does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise. Deaths have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists and during initiation of methadone treatment of addiction in subjects previously abusing high doses of other agonists. Treatment of PainOptimal methadone initiation and dose titration strategies for the treatment of pain have not been determined. Published equianalgesic conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are imprecise, providing at best, only population averages that cannot be applied consistently to all patients. It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non-tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated-dose settings. Regardless of the dose determination strategy employed, methadone is most safely initiated and titrated using small initial doses and gradual dose adjustments. As with all opioid drugs, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. The following dosing recommendations should only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient. Prescribers should always follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring. In the selection of an initial dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets, attention should be given to the following: The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient had been taking previously, if any; The relative potency estimate used to calculate an equianalgesic starting methadone dose, in particular, whether it is intended for use in acute or chronic methadone dosing; The patient's degree of opioid tolerance; The age, general condition and medical status of the patient; Concurrent medications, particularly other CNS and respiratory depressants; The type, severity and expected duration of the patient's pain; The acceptable balance between pain control and adverse side effects. Initiation of Therapy in Opioid Non-Tolerant PatientsWhen oral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual oral methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect. More frequent administration may be required during methadone initiation in order to maintain adequate analgesia, and extreme caution is necessary to avoid overdosage, taking into account methadone's long elimination half-life. Conversion from Parenteral Methadone to Oral MethadoneConversion from parenteral methadone to oral methadone should initially use a 1:2 dose ratio (e.g., 5 mg parenteral methadone to 10 mg oral methadone). Switching Patients to Methadone from other Chronic OpioidsSwitching a patient from another chronically administered opioid to methadone requires caution due to the uncertainty of dose conversion ratios and incomplete cross-tolerance. Deaths have occurred in opioid tolerant patients during conversion to methadone. Conversion ratios in many commonly used equianalgesic dosing tables do not apply in the setting of repeated methadone dosing. Although with single-dose administration the onset and duration of analgesic action, as well as the analgesic potency of methadone and morphine, are similar methadone's potency increases over time with repeated dosing. Furthermore, the conversion ratio between methadone and other opiates varies dramatically depending on baseline opiate (morphine equivalent) use as shown in the table below. The dose conversion scheme below is derived from various consensus guidelines for converting chronic pain patients to methadone from morphine. Clinicians should consult published conversion guidelines to determine the equivalent morphine dose for patients converting from other opioids. Table 1. Oral Morphine to Oral Methadone Conversion for Chronic Administration Total Daily Baseline Oral Morphine Dose Estimated Daily Oral Methadone Requirement as Percent of Total Daily Morphine Dose less than 100 mg 20% to 30% 100 to 300 mg 10% to 20% 300 to 600 mg 8% to 12% 600 mg to 1000 mg 5% to 10% greater than 1000 mg less than 5 % The total daily methadone dose derived from the table above may then be divided to reflect the intended dosing schedule (i.e., for administration every 8 hours, divide total daily methadone dose by 3). Note Equianalgesic methadone dosing varies not only between patients, but also within the same patient, depending on baseline morphine (or other opioid) dose. Table 1 has been included in order to illustrate this concept and to provide a safe starting point for opioid conversion. Methadone dosing should not be based solely on these tables. Methadone conversion and dose titration methods should always be individualized to account for the patient's prior opioid exposure, general medical condition, concomitant medication, and anticipated breakthrough medication use. The endpoint of titration is achievement of adequate pain relief, balanced against tolerability of opioid side effects. If a patient develops intolerable opioid related side effects, the methadone dose, or dosing interval, may need to be adjusted. Dosage Adjustment During PregnancyMethadone clearance may be increased during pregnancy. Several small studies have demonstrated significantly lower trough methadone plasma concentrations and shorter methadone half-lives in women during their pregnancy compared to after their delivery. During pregnancy a woman's methadone dose may need to be increased, or their dosing interval decreased. Methadone should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Detoxification and Maintenance Treatment of Opiate Dependence For detoxification and maintenance of opiate dependence methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8.12, including limitations on unsupervised administration. Induction/Initial DosingThe initial methadone dose should be administered, under supervision, when there are no signs of sedation or intoxication, and the patient shows symptoms of withdrawal. Initially, a single dose of 20 to 30 mg of methadone will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms. The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg. If same-day dosing adjustments are to be made, the patient should be asked to wait 2 to 4 hours for further evaluation, when peak levels have been reached. An additional 5 to 10 mg of methadone may be provided if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear. The total daily dose of methadone on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg. Dose adjustments should be made over the first week of treatment based on control of withdrawal symptoms at the time of expected peak activity (e.g., 2 to 4 hours after dosing). Dose adjustment should be cautious; deaths have occurred in early treatment due to the cumulative effects of the first several days' dosing. Patients should be reminded that the dose will hold for a longer period of time as tissue stores of methadone accumulate. Initial doses should be lower for patients whose tolerance is expected to be low at treatment entry. Loss of tolerance should be considered in any patient who has not taken opioids for more than 5 days. Initial doses should not be determined by previous treatment episodes or dollars spent per day on illicit drug use. For Short-Term DetoxificationFor patients preferring a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, it is generally recommended that the patient be titrated to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level. Stabilization can be continued for 2 to 3 days, after which the dose of methadone should be gradually decreased. The rate at which methadone is decreased should be determined separately for each patient. The dose of methadone can be decreased on a daily basis or at 2-day intervals, but the amount of intake should remain sufficient to keep withdrawal symptoms at a tolerable level. In hospitalized patients, a daily reduction of 20% of the total daily dose may be tolerated. In ambulatory patients, a somewhat slower schedule may be needed. For Maintenance TreatmentPatients in maintenance treatment should be titrated to a dose at which opioid symptoms are prevented for 24 hours, drug hunger or craving is reduced, the euphoric effects of self-administered opioids are blocked or attenuated, and the patient is tolerant to the sedative effects of methadone. Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg/day. For Medically Supervised Withdrawal After a Period of Maintenance TreatmentThere is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment. It is generally suggested that dose reductions should be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and that 10 to 14-day intervals should elapse between dose reductions. Patients should be apprised of the high risk of relapse to illicit drug use associated with discontinuation of methadone maintenance treatment.","activeIngredient":3061849},{"uuid":"50881-005","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"JAKAFI","proprietaryName":"Incyte Corporation","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1.

Delay starting therapy with Jakafi until active serious infections have resolved. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis infection has been reported in patients receiving Jakafi. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis and manage promptly. Prior to initiating Jakafi, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors, and those at higher risk should be tested for latent infection. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, prior residence in or travel to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, and a history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. For patients with evidence of active or latent tuberculosis, consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis before starting Jakafi. The decision to continue Jakafi during treatment of active tuberculosis should be based on the overall risk-benefit determination. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred with Jakafitreatment. If PML is suspected, stop Jakafi and evaluate. Herpes Zoster Advise patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster and to seek treatment as early as possible if suspected [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections taking Jakafi. The effect of Jakafi on viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is unknown. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical guidelines. 5.3 Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment with Jakafi Following discontinuation of Jakafi, symptoms from myeloproliferative neoplasms may return to pretreatment levels over a period of approximately one week. Some patients with MFhave experienced one or more of the following adverse events after discontinuing Jakafi: fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, DIC, or multi-organ failure. If one or more of these occur after discontinuation of, or while tapering the dose of Jakafi, evaluate for and treat any intercurrent illness and consider restarting or increasing the dose of Jakafi. Instruct patients not to interrupt or discontinue Jakafi therapy without consulting their physician. When discontinuing or interrupting therapy with Jakafi for reasons other than thrombocytopenia or neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)], consider tapering the dose of Jakafi gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly. 5.4 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with Jakafi.

The safety of Jakafi was assessed in 617patients in six clinical studies with a median duration of follow-up of 10.9 months, including 301patients with MFin two Phase 3 studies. In these two Phase 3 studies, patients had a median duration of exposure to Jakafi of 9.5 months (range 0.5 to 17 months), with 89% of patients treated for more than 6 months and 25% treated for more than 12 months. One hundred and eleven (111) patients started treatment at 15mg twice daily and 190 patients started at 20mg twice daily. In patients starting treatment with 15mg twice daily (pretreatment platelet counts of 100 to 200X109/L) and 20mg twice daily (pretreatment platelet counts greater than 200X109/L), 65% and 25% of patients, respectively, required a dose reduction below the starting dose within the first 8 weeks of therapy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of Jakafi, among the 155 patients treated with Jakafi, the most frequent adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anemia [seeTable 11]. Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia are dose related effects. The three most frequent non-hematologic adverse reactions were bruising, dizziness and headache [see Table 10]. Discontinuation for adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 11% of patients treated with Jakafi and 11% of patients treated with placebo. Table 10 presents the most common adverse reactions occurring in patients who received Jakafi in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study during randomized treatment.

One patient (<1%) discontinued treatment because of anemia. In patients receiving Jakafi, mean decreases in hemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 g/dL below baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new steady state that was approximately 1.0 g/dL below baseline. This pattern was observed in patients regardless of whether they had received transfusions during therapy. In the randomized, placebo-controlled study, 60% of patients treated with Jakafi and 38% of patients receiving placebo received red blood cell transfusions during randomized treatment. Among transfused patients, the median number of units transfused per month was 1.2 in patients treated with Jakafi and 1.7 in placebo treated patients. Thrombocytopenia In the two Phase 3 clinical studies, in patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to onset was approximately 8 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with dose reduction or dose interruption. The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50X109/L was 14 days. Platelet transfusions were administered to 5% of patients receiving Jakafi and to 4% of patients receiving control regimens. Discontinuation of treatment because of thrombocytopenia occurred in <1% of patients receiving Jakafi and <1% of patients receiving control regimens. Patients with a platelet count of 100X109/L to 200X109/L before starting Jakafi had a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to patients with a platelet count greater than 200X109/L (17% versus 7%). Neutropenia In the two Phase 3 clinical studies, 1% of patients reduced or stopped Jakafi because of neutropenia. Table 11 provides the frequency and severity of clinical hematology abnormalities reported for patients receiving treatment with Jakafi or placebo in the placebo-controlled study.

The incidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 elevations was 2% for Jakafi with 1% Grade 3 and no Grade 4 ALT elevations. 17% of patients treated with Jakafi and 6% of patients treated with placebo developed newly occurring or worsening Grade 1 abnormalities in aspartate transaminase (AST). The incidence of Grade 2 AST elevations was <1% for Jakafi with no Grade 3 or 4 AST elevations. 17% of patients treated with Jakafi and <1% of patients treated with placebo developed newly occurring or worsening Grade 1 elevations in cholesterol. The incidence of Grade 2 cholesterol elevations was <1% for Jakafi with no Grade 3 or 4 cholesterol elevations. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Polycythemia Vera In a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study, 110 patients with PV resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea received Jakafi and 111 patients received best available therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most frequent adverse drug reaction was anemia. Table 12 presents the most frequent non-hematologic treatment emergent adverse events occurring up to Week 32. Discontinuation for adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 4% of patients treated with Jakafi.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Doses should be individualized based on safety and efficacy. Starting doses per indication are noted below. Myelofibrosis (2.1) The starting dose of Jakafi is based on patients baseline platelet count: Greater than 200 X 109/L: 20 mg given orally twice daily 100 X 109/L to 200 X 109/L: 15 mg given orally twice daily 50 X 109/L to less than 100 X 109/L: 5 mg given orally twice daily Monitor complete blood counts every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated. Modify or interrupt dosing for thrombocytopenia. Polycythemia Vera (2.2) The starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg given orally twice daily. 2.1 Myelofibrosis The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is based on platelet count (Table 1). A complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count must be performed before initiating therapy, every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. Table 1: Jakafi Starting Doses for Myelofibrosis Platelet Count Starting Dose Greater than 200X109/L 20mg orally twice daily 100X109/L to 200X109/L 15mg orally twice daily 50X109/L to less than 100X109/L 5mg orally twice daily 2.1.1 Dose Modification Guidelines for Hematologic Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100X109/L or Greater Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for platelet counts less than 50X109/L or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 0.5 X109/L. After recovery of platelet counts above 50X109/L and ANC above 0.75X109/L, dosing may be restarted. Table 2 illustrates the maximum allowable dose that may be used in restarting Jakafi after a previous interruption. Table 2: Myelofibrosis: Maximum Restarting Doses for Jakafi after Safety Interruption for Thrombocytopenia for Patients Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100X109/L or Greater Current Platelet Count Maximum Dose When Restarting Jakafi TreatmentMaximum doses are displayed. When restarting, begin with a dose at least 5mg twice daily below the dose at interruption. Greater than or equal to 125X109/L 20mg twice daily 100 to less than 125X109/L 15mg twice daily 75 to less than 100X109/L 10mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks; if stable, may increase to 15mg twice daily 50 to less than 75X109/L 5mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks; if stable, may increase to 10mg twice daily Less than 50X109/L Continue hold Following treatment interruption for ANC below 0.5 X109/L, after ANC recovers to 0.75X109/L or greater, restart dosing at the higher of 5mg once daily or 5mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the treatment interruption. Dose Reductions Dose reductions should be considered if the platelet counts decrease as outlined in Table 3 with the goal of avoiding dose interruptions for thrombocytopenia. Table 3: Myelofibrosis: Dosing Recommendations for Thrombocytopenia for Patients Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 X 109/L or Greater Dose at Time of Platelet Decline Platelet Count 25mg twice daily 20mg twice daily 15mg twice daily 10mg twice daily 5mg twice daily New Dose New Dose New Dose New Dose New Dose 100 to less than 125X109/L 20mg twice daily 15mg twice daily No Change No Change No Change 75 to less than 100X109/L 10mg twice daily 10mg twice daily 10mg twice daily No Change No Change 50 to less than 75X109/L 5mg twice daily 5mg twice daily 5mg twice daily 5mg twice daily No Change Less than 50X109/L Hold Hold Hold Hold Hold 2.1.2 Dose Modification Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100X109/L or Greater If the response is insufficient and platelet and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25mg twice daily. Doses should not be increased during the first 4weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every 2weeks. Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions: Failure to achieve a reduction from pretreatment baseline in either palpable spleen length of 50% or a 35% reduction in spleen volume as measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Platelet count greater than 125X109/L at 4 weeks and platelet count never below 100X109/L; ANC Levels greater than 0.75X109/L. Based on limited clinical data, long-term maintenance at a 5mg twice daily dose has not shown responses and continued use at this dose should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy. 2.1.3 Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with Platelet Counts of 50X109/L to Less Than 100X109/L This section applies only to patients with platelet counts of 50X109/L to less than 100X109/L prior to any treatment with Jakafi. See Section 2.1.1 for dose modifications for hematological toxicity in patients whose platelet counts were 100X109/L or more prior to starting treatment with Jakafi. Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for platelet counts less than 25X109/L or ANC less than 0.5 X109/L. After recovery of platelet counts above 35X109/L and ANC above 0.75X109/L, dosing may be restarted. Restart dosing at the higher of 5mg once daily or 5mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the decrease in platelet count below 25X109/L or ANC below 0.5 X109/L that led to dose interruption. Dose Reductions Reduce the dose of Jakafifor platelet counts less than 35X109/L as described in Table 4. Table 4: Myelofibrosis: Dosing Modifications for Thrombocytopenia for Patients with Starting Platelet Count of 50 X 109/L to Less Than 100 X 109/L Platelet Count Dosing Recommendations Less than 25X109/L Interrupt dosing. 25 X 109/L to less than 35X109/L AND the platelet count decline is less than 20% during the prior four weeks Decrease dose by 5mg once daily. For patients on 5mg once daily, maintain dose at 5mg once daily. 25X109/L to less than 35X109/L AND the platelet count decline is 20% or greater during the prior four weeks Decrease dose by 5mg twice daily. For patients on 5mg twice daily, decrease the dose to 5mg once daily. For patients on 5mg once daily, maintain dose at 5mg once daily. 2.1.4 Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Myelofibrosis and Starting Platelet Count of 50X109/L to Less Than 100X109/L Do not increase doses during the first 4 weeks of therapy, and do not increase the dose more frequently than every 2 weeks. If the response is insufficient as defined in Section 2.1.2, doses may be increased by increments of 5mg daily to a maximum of 10mg twice daily if: the platelet count has remained at least 40X109/L, and the platelet count has not fallen by more than 20% in the prior 4 weeks, and the ANC is more than 1X109/L, and the dose has not been reduced or interrupted for an adverse event or hematological toxicity in the prior 4 weeks. Continuation of treatment for more than 6 months should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy. 2.1.5 Dose Modification for Bleeding Interrupt treatment for bleeding requiring intervention regardless of current platelet count. Once the bleeding event has resolved, consider resuming treatment at the prior dose if the underlying cause of bleeding has been controlled. If the bleeding event has resolved but the underlying cause persists, consider resuming treatment with Jakafi at a lower dose. 2.2 Polycythemia Vera The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg twice daily. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. 2.2.1 Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Polycythemia Vera A complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count must be performed before initiating therapy, every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Dose Reductions Dose reductions should be considered for hemoglobin and platelet count decreases as described in Table 5. Table 5: Polycythemia Vera: Dose Reductions Hemoglobin and/or Platelet Count Dosing Recommendations Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12g/dL AND platelet count greater than or equal to 100X109/L No change required. Hemoglobin 10 to less than 12g/dL AND platelet count 75 to less than 100X109/L Dose reductions should be considered with the goal of avoiding dose interruptions for anemia and thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobin 8 to less than 10g/dL OR platelet count 50 to less than 75X109/L Reduce dose by 5mg twice daily. For patients on 5mg twice daily, decrease the dose to 5mg once daily. Hemoglobin less than 8g/dL OR platelet count less than 50X109/L Interrupt dosing. Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL, platelet counts less than 50 X 109/L or ANC less than 1.0 X 109/L. After recovery of the hematologic parameter(s) to acceptable levels, dosing may be restarted. Table 6 illustrates the dose that may be used in restarting Jakafi after a previous interruption. Table 6: Polycythemia Vera: Restarting Doses for Jakafi after Safety Interruption for Hematologic Parameter(s) Use the most severe category of a patients hemoglobin, platelet count, or ANC abnormality to determine the corresponding maximum restarting dose. Hemoglobin, Platelet Count, or ANC Maximum Restarting Dose Hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL OR platelet count less than 50 X 109/L OR ANC less than 1 X 109/L Continue hold Hemoglobin 8 to less than 10 g/dL OR platelet count 50 to less than 75 X 109/L OR ANC 1 to less than 1.5 X 109/L 5 mg twice dailyContinue treatment for at least 2 weeks; if stable, may increase dose by 5 mg twice daily.or no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption Hemoglobin 10 to less than 12 g/dL OR platelet count 75 to less than 100 X 109/L OR ANC 1.5 to less than 2 X 109/L 10 mg twice dailyor no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g/dL OR platelet count greater than or equal to 100 X 109/L OR ANC greater than or equal to 2 X 109/L 15 mg twice dailyor no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption Patients who had required dose interruption while receiving a dose of 5 mg twice daily, may restart at a dose of 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg once daily, but not higher, once hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 10 g/dL, platelet count is greater than or equal to 75 X 109/L, and ANC is greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109/L. Dose Management after Restarting Treatment After restarting Jakafi following treatment interruption, doses may be titrated, but the maximum total daily dose should not exceed 5 mg less than the dose that resulted in the dose interruption. An exception to this is dose interruption following phlebotomy-associated anemia, in which case the maximal total daily dose allowed after restarting Jakafi would not be limited. 2.2.2 Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Polycythemia Vera If the response is insufficient and platelet, hemoglobin, and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily. Doses should not be increased during the first 4 weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every two weeks. Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions: Inadequate efficacy as demonstrated by one or more of the following: Continued need for phlebotomy WBC greater than the upper limit of normal range Platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal range Palpable spleen that is reduced by less than 25% from Baseline Platelet count greater than or equal to 140 X 109/L Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g/dL ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109/L 2.3 Dose Modifications forConcomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole Modify the Jakafi dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and fluconazole doses of less than or equal to 200mg [see Drug Interactions (7)], according to Table 7. Additional dose modifications should be made with frequent monitoring of safety and efficacy. Avoid the use of fluconazole doses of greater than 200mg daily with Jakafi. Table 7: Dose Modifications for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole For patients coadministered strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole doses of less than or equal to 200 mg Recommended Dose Modification Starting dose for patients with MF with a platelet count: Greater than or equal to 100 X 109/L 10 mg twice daily 50X109/L to less than 100X109/L 5 mg once daily Starting dose for patients with PV: 5 mg twice daily If on stable dose for patients with PV: Greater than or equal to 10mg twice daily Decrease dose by 50% (round up to the closest available tablet strength) 5mg twice daily 5 mg once daily 5mg once daily Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or fluconazole treatment or interrupt Jakafi treatment for the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or fluconazole use 2.4 Dose Modifications for Organ Impairment Renal Impairment Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Impairment Modify the Jakafi dosage for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment according to Table 8.

The recommended starting dose for patients with PVwithESRD on dialysis is 10mg. Make additional dose modificationswith frequent monitoring of safety and efficacy. Avoid use of Jakafi in patients withESRD (CLcr less than 15mL/min) not requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Hepatic Impairment Modify the Jakafi dosage for patients with hepatic impairment according to Table 9.

If a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but should take the next usual prescribed dose. When discontinuing Jakafi therapy for reasons other than thrombocytopenia, gradual tapering of the dose of Jakafi may be considered, for example by 5mg twice daily each week. For patients unable to ingest tablets, Jakafi can be administered through a nasogastric tube (8 French or greater) as follows: Suspend one tablet in approximately 40 mL of water with stirring for approximately 10 minutes. Within 6 hours after the tablet has dispersed, the suspension can be administered through a nasogastric tube using an appropriate syringe. The tube should be rinsed with approximately 75 mL of water. The effect of tube feeding preparations on Jakafi exposure during administration through a nasogastric tube has not been evaluated.","activeIngredient":3117450},{"uuid":"17478-102","administrationRoute":"OPHTHALMIC","dosageForm":"SOLUTION/ DROPS","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Tropicamide","proprietaryName":"Akorn, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE: For mydriasis and cycloplegia for diagnostic procedures.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS: Contraindicated in persons showing hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation.","howSupplied":"HOW SUPPLIED: Tropicamide Ophthalmic Solution USP, 0.5% and 1% are supplied as sterile solutions in plastic dropper bottles. 0.5% NDC 17478-101-12 (15 mL) 1% NDC 17478-102-12 (15 mL) 1% NDC 17478-102-20 (2 mL) STORAGE: Store at 20 to 25C (68 to 77F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Efficacy was established in an active- controlled study (1.2, 14.2). 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)]. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis).

Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (5.10). Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.10). Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. (5.10). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. (5.11). Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur (5.12). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.13). Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest, pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.14). Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.15). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.16). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \"segs\" plus neutrophil \"bands\"). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, \"severe neutropenia\" replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/L, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2 ) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/L) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than () 1500/L are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/L for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/L for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Section 2.4 If clinically appropriate Table 2. Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (1500/L) Initiate treatment If treatment interrupted: - < 30 days, continue monitoring as before - 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/L) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC 1500/ L Once ANC 1500/L, return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/L) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia Resume treatment once ANC 1000/L Daily until ANC 1000/ L, then Three times weekly until ANC 1500/ L Once ANC 1500/ L, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/L) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine- induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC 1000/ L, then Three times weekly until ANC 1500/ L If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC 1500/L Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3 ) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than \"standard\" laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. -< 30 days, continue monitoring as before Section 2.4 If clinically appropriate Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline 1000/L ) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted - 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/L Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC 1000/L or patient's known baseline Once ANC 1000/L or at patient's known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal BEN Range\" ANC monitoring interval. BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/L Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine- induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC 500/L, then Three times weekly until ANC patient's baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC 1000/uL or at patient's baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5 C [101.3 F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/L: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/L, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/L (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient's medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine. Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long term antipsychotic therapy. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. These cases reported either mild or moderate mitral regurgitation on two-dimensional echocardiography. In patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, consider a 2D-echo Doppler examination to identify mitral valve incompetence. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment- emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Known serious hypersensitivity to clozapine or any other component of clozapine tablets (4.1). 4.1 Hypersensitivity Clozapine tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity to clozapine (e.g., photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) or any other component of clozapine tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied Clozapine tablets are available as 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg round, flat face, bevel edge, pale-yellow, tablets with a score on one side and as a 200 mg oval shape, pale-yellow tablet with a score on one side.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions.

Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule (2.2, 5.3). Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated (2.2). Target dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks (2.2). Subsequent increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly (2.2). Maximum daily dose: 900 mg (2.2). 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/L for the general population, and at least 1000/L for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient's last ANC: See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine tablets therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is 1500/L and for BEN patients until their ANC is 1000/L or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5 C or 101.3 F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have discontinued clozapine tablets (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] If that dose is well-tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Table 1. Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co- medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine tablets while taking a co- medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine tablet dose. Increase clozapine tablet dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablet dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine tablet dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if the inducer is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablet dose. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Reduce clozapine tablet dose based on clinical response. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Consider increasing the clozapine tablet dose if necessary. Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablet dose if necessary. 2.7 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablet dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].","activeIngredient":3058736},{"uuid":"0378-9671","administrationRoute":"RESPIRATORY (INHALATION)","dosageForm":"SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate","proprietaryName":"Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is indicated for the treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD in patients requiring more than one bronchodilator.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its components, or to atropine and its derivatives.","howSupplied":"HOW SUPPLIED Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is supplied as a 3-mL sterile solution for nebulization in sterile low-density polyethylene unit-dose vials.

(5.1) Need for more doses of VENTOLIN HFA than usual may be a sign of deterioration of asthma and requires reevaluation of treatment. (5.2) Cardiovascular effects may occur with beta-adrenergic agonists use. Consider discontinuation of VENTOLIN HFA if these effects occur. Use with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. (5.4) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Discontinue VENTOLIN HFA if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur. (5.6) 5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled albuterol sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, VENTOLIN HFA should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister. 5.2 Deterioration of Asthma Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of VENTOLIN HFA than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids. 5.3 Use of Anti-Inflammatory Agents The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen. 5.4 Cardiovascular Effects VENTOLIN HFA, like all other beta2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, VENTOLIN HFA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the Twave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, VENTOLIN HFA, like all other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. 5.5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected. 5.6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. Discontinue VENTOLIN HFA if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur. 5.7 Coexisting Conditions VENTOLIN HFA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.8 Hypokalemia As with other beta-agonists, albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VENTOLIN HFA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any other components of VENTOLIN HFA.

The pouch and dessicant should be discarded. VENTOLIN HFA should be discarded 12 months after removal from the pouch. Priming VENTOLIN HFA is essential to ensure appropriate albuterol content in each actuation. To prime the inhaler, release 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray. The inhaler should be primed before using it for the first time, when the inhaler has not been used for more than 2weeks, or when it has been dropped. After priming, each actuation delivers 120mcg of albuterol sulfate, USP in 75mg of suspension from the valve and 108mcg of albuterol sulfate, USP from the mouthpiece (equivalent to 90mcg of albuterol base from the mouthpiece). To ensure proper dosing and to prevent actuator orifice blockage, wash the actuator with warm water and let it air-dry completely at least once a week [see FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (17.8)]. The blue actuator supplied with VENTOLIN HFA should not be used with any other product canisters, and actuators from other products should not be used with a VENTOLIN HFA canister. VENTOLIN HFA has a counter attached to the canister. The counter starts at 204 or 64 and counts down each time a spray is released. The correct amount of medication in each inhalation cannot be assured after the counter reads 000, even though the canister is not completely empty and will continue to operate. VENTOLIN HFA should be discarded when the counter reads 000 or 12 months after removal from the moisture-protective foil pouch, whichever comes first. Never immerse the canister in water to determine the amount of drug remaining in the canister. Keep out of reach of children. Avoid spraying in eyes. Contents Under Pressure: Do not puncture. Do not use or store near heat or open flame. Exposure to temperatures above 120F may cause bursting. Never throw container into fire or incinerator. Store between 15 and 25C (59 and 77F). Store the inhaler with the mouthpiece down. For best results, the inhaler should be at room temperature before use. SHAKE WELL BEFORE EACH SPRAY. VENTOLIN HFA does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant.","adverseReaction":"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of VENTOLIN HFA may be associated with the following: Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Cardiovascular effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence 3%) are throat irritation, viral respiratory infections, upper respiratory inflammation, cough, and musculoskeletal pain.

The data from adults and adolescents is based upon 2 clinical trials in which 202 patients with asthma 12 years of age and older were treated with VENTOLIN HFA 2 inhalations 4 times daily for 12 weeks duration. The adult/adolescent population was 92 female, 110 male and 163 white, 19 black, 18 Hispanic, 2 other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 1 clinical trial in which 46 patients with asthma 4 to 11 years of age were treated with VENTOLIN HFA 2 inhalations 4 times daily for 2 weeks duration. The population was 21 female, 25 male and 25 white, 17 black, 3 Hispanic, 1 other. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older The two 12-week, randomized, double-blind studies in 610 adolescent and adult patients with asthma that compared VENTOLIN HFA, a CFC11/12-propelled albuterol inhaler, and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler. Overall, the incidence and nature of the adverse reactions reported for VENTOLIN HFA and a CFC11/12-propelled albuterol inhaler were comparable. Table 1 lists the incidence of all adverse reactions (whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug) from these studies that occurred at a rate of 3% or greater in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA and more frequently in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA than in the HFA-134a placebo inhaler group.

Adverse reactions reported by less than 3% of the adolescent and adult patients receiving VENTOLIN HFA and by a greater proportion of patients receiving VENTOLIN HFA than receiving HFA-134a placebo inhaler and that have the potential to be related to VENTOLINHFA include diarrhea, laryngitis, oropharyngeal edema, cough, lung disorders, tachycardia, and extrasystoles. Palpitation and dizziness have also been observed with VENTOLIN HFA. Pediatric Patients Results from the 2-week pediatric clinical study in patients with asthma 4 to 11 years of age showed that this pediatric population had an adverse reaction profile similar to that of the adolescent and adult populations. Three studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA in patients between birth and 4 years of age. The results of these studies did not establish the efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA in this age-group [see Pediatric Use (8.4)]. Since the efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA has not been demonstrated in children between birth and 48months of age, the safety of VENTOLIN HFA in this age-group cannot be established. However, the safety profile observed in the pediatric population under 4 years of age was comparable to that observed in the older pediatric patients and in adolescents and adults. Where adverse reaction incidence rates were greater in patients under 4 years of age compared with older patients, the higher incidence rates were noted in all treatment arms, including placebo. These adverse reactions included upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, and tachycardia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions listed in section 6.1, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VENTOLIN HFA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of paradoxical bronchospasm, hoarseness, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia), and hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria, angioedema, rash) have been reported after the use of VENTOLIN HFA. In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypokalemia, hypertension, peripheral vasodilatation, angina, tremor, central nervous system stimulation, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, headache, muscle cramps, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.","drugClass":"salbutamol","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer VENTOLIN HFA by oral inhalation only.

Monitor patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.3) Urinary retention: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (5.4) Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: Discontinue COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and institute alternative therapy if immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or oropharyngeal edema occur (5.6) Coexisting conditions: Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus (5.7) 5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm COMBIVENT RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 5.2 Cardiovascular Effect The albuterol sulfate contained in COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, like other betaadrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If these symptoms occur, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. There is some evidence from post-marketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of myocardial ischemia associated with albuterol. In addition, betaadrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders; especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.3 Ocular Effects Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may increase intraocular pressure. This may result in precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients should avoid spraying COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into the eyes. If a patient sprays COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into their eyes they may cause acute eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, mydriasis, visual halos, or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival or corneal congestion. Advise patients to consult their physician immediately if any of these symptoms develop while using COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. 5.4 Urinary Retention Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may cause urinary retention. Therefore, caution is advised when administering this medication to patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema may occur after administration of ipratropium bromide or albuterol sulfate. In clinical trials and post-marketing experience with ipratropium containing products, hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rash, pruritus, angioedema of tongue, lips and face, urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm and anaphylactic reactions have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2) ]. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Coexisting Conditions COMBIVENT RESPIMAT contains albuterol sulfate, a beta2-adrenergic sympathomimetic amine and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. 5.8 Hypokalemia Beta2adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients (possibly through intracellular shunting) which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects.

Of these patients, 486 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (88.5%) patients with a mean age of 63.8 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1 at screening of 41.5%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction were excluded from the trial. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 2% in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT treatment group in the 12-week COPD trial. The frequency of the corresponding adverse reactions in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler groups is included for comparison. The rates are derived from all reported adverse reactions of that type not present at baseline, whether considered drug-related or not by the clinical investigator.

Of these patients, 157 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (93.5%) patients with a mean age of 62.9 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1 at screening of 47.0%. An evaluation of the safety data from the trial revealed that most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between treatment groups. However, cough occurred more frequently in patients enrolled in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group (7.0%) compared to those in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (2.6%) or the free combination of ipratropium bromide and albuterol HFA inhalation aerosols (3.9%) groups. In addition to the adverse reactions reported in the controlled clinical trial with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, adverse reaction information concerning CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol is derived from two 12-week controlled clinical trials (N=358 for CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol). Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dyspnea, cough, pain, respiratory disorder, sinusitis, pharyngitis and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in <2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: edema, fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, nervousness, tremor, dysphonia, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, vomiting, arrhythmia, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, angina, increased sputum, taste perversion, urinary tract infection, dysuria, dry throat and bronchospasm. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol. Since CFC-propelled Combivent Inhalation Aerosol and Combivent Respimat contain the same active ingredients, one should take into account the fact that the adverse reactions seen with CFC-propelled Combivent Inhalation Aerosol could also occur with Combivent Respimat.

Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore, treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see WARNINGS ). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever, chills, arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively, Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption, sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However, with current usage, skin reactions have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS ). Most Common Reactions* Probably Causally Related Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase increase, SGOT/SGPT increase Metabolic and Nutritional: acute attacks of gout Skin and Appendages: rash, maculopapular rash *Early clinical studies and incidence rates from early clinical experience with allopurinol suggested that these adverse reactions were found to occur at a rate of greater than 1%. The most frequent event observed was acute attacks of gout following the initiation of therapy. Analyses of current usage suggest that the incidence of these adverse reactions is now less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined, but it may be due to following recommended usage (see ADVERSE REACTIONS introduction, INDICATIONS AND USAGE , PRECAUTIONS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

The average is 200 to 300 mg/day for patients with mild gout and 400 to 600 mg/day for those with moderately severe tophaceous gout. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Dosage requirements in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. The minimal effective dosage is 100 to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. To reduce the possibility of flare-up of acute gouty attacks, it is recommended that the patient start with a low dose of allopurinol (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is attained but without exceeding the maximal recommended dosage. Normal serum urate levels are usually achieved in one to three weeks. The upper limit of normal is about 7 mg/dL for men and postmenopausal women and 6 mg/dL for premenopausal women. Too much reliance should not be placed on a single serum uric acid determination since, for technical reasons, estimation of uric acid may be difficult. By selecting the appropriate dosage and, in certain patients, using uricosuric agents concurrently, it is possible to reduce serum uric acid to normal or, if desired, to as low as 2 to 3 mg/dL and keep it there indefinitely. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, it is wise to continue the latter therapy until serum uric acid has been normalized and there has been freedom from acute gouty attacks for several months. In transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to allopurinol, the dose of the uricosuric agent should be gradually reduced over a period of several weeks and the dose of allopurinol gradually increased to the required dose needed to maintain a normal serum uric acid level. It should also be noted that allopurinol is generally better tolerated if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least two liters and the maintenance of a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable. Since allopurinol and its metabolites are primarily eliminated only by the kidney, accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure, and the dose of allopurinol should consequently be reduced. With a creatinine clearance of 10 to 20 mL/min, a daily dosage of 200 mg of allopurinol is suitable. When the creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL/min, the daily dosage should not exceed 100 mg. With extreme renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 3 mL/min) the interval between doses may also need to be lengthened. The correct size and frequency of dosage for maintaining the serum uric acid just within the normal range is best determined by using the serum uric acid level as an index. For the prevention of uric acid nephropathy during the vigorous therapy of neoplastic disease, treatment with 600 to 800 mg daily for two or three days is advisable together with a high fluid intake. Otherwise similar considerations to the above recommendations for treating patients with gout govern the regulation of dosage for maintenance purposes in secondary hyperuricemia. The dose of allopurinol recommended for management of recurrent calcium oxalate stones in hyperuricosuric patients is 200 to 300 mg/day in divided doses or as the single equivalent. This dose may be adjusted up or down depending upon the resultant control of the hyperuricosuria based upon subsequent 24 hour urinary urate determinations. Clinical experience suggests that patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones may also benefit from dietary changes such as the reduction of animal protein, sodium, refined sugars, oxalate-rich foods, and excessive calcium intake, as well as an increase in oral fluids and dietary fiber. Children, 6 to 10 years of age, with secondary hyperuricemia associated with malignancies may be given 300 mg allopurinol daily while those under 6 years are generally given 150 mg daily. The response is evaluated after approximately 48 hours of therapy and a dosage adjustment is made if necessary.","activeIngredient":3122723},{"uuid":"70785-022","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Duzallo","proprietaryName":"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DUZALLO, a combination of lesinurad, a uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor, and allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. DUZALLO, a combination of lesinurad, a URAT1 inhibitor, and allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. (1) Limitations of Use: DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. (1.1) 1.1 Limitations of Use DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal events: Adverse reactions related to renal function, including acute renal failure, have occurred after initiating lesinurad, one of the components of DUZALLO. A higher incidence has occurred at the 400 mg dose of lesinurad than at the 200 mg dose. Monitor renal function at initiation and during therapy with DUZALLO, particularly in patients with eCLcr below 60 mL/min, and evaluate for signs and symptoms of acute uric acid nephropathy. (5.1) Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity: DUZALLO, should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs that may indicate an allergic reaction, as allopurinol has been associated with severe hypersensitivity (some resulting in death). (5.2) Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients on allopurinol. Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. If symptoms develop, liver function evaluation should be performed. (5.3) Cardiovascular events: Major adverse cardiovascular events were observed with lesinurad; a causal relationship has not been established. (5.4) Bone Marrow Suppression: Bone marrow depression affecting one or more cell lines has been reported with allopurinol. (5.5) 5.1 Renal Events Adverse reactions related to renal function, including acute renal failure, can occur after initiating DUZALLO. Treatment with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol was associated with an increased incidence of serum creatinine elevations, most of which were reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. A higher incidence of serum creatinine elevations and renal-related adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions of acute renal failure, were observed with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol, with the highest incidence when lesinurad was given alone. DUZALLO treatment should be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to greater than 2 times the value when lesinurad treatment was initiated. In patients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy including flank pain, nausea or vomiting, interrupt treatment and measure serum creatinine promptly. DUZALLO should not be restarted without another explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities. DUZALLO should not be initiated in patients with an eCLcr less than 45 mL/min. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of DUZALLO and periodically thereafter, as clinically indicated. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eCLcr less than 60 mL/min [see Renal Impairment (8.6) ] or with serum creatinine elevations 1.5 to 2 times the value when lesinurad treatment was initiated. Some patients with pre-existing renal disease or poor urate clearance have shown a rise in BUN during administration of allopurinol. 5.2 Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity Skin rash is a frequently reported adverse event in patients taking allopurinol [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. In some instances, a skin rash may be followed by more severe hypersensitivity reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and/or eosinophilia including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Associated vasculitis and tissue response may be manifested in various ways including hepatitis, renal impairment, seizures, and on rare occasions, death. The HLA-B*5801 allele is a genetic risk marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol. DUZALLO should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs which may indicate an allergic reaction, and additional medical care should be provided as needed. Hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol may be increased in patients with decreased renal function receiving thiazide diuretics and DUZALLO concurrently. For this reason, in this clinical setting, such combinations should be administered with caution and patients should be observed closely. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity A few cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients taking allopurinol, and in some patients, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus develops in patients on DUZALLO, evaluation of liver function should be performed. In patients with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function tests are recommended. 5.4 Cardiovascular Events In clinical trials with lesinurad and allopurinol, major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.5 Bone Marrow Depression Bone marrow depression has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol, most of whom received concomitant drugs with the potential for causing this reaction. This has occurred as early as six weeks to as long as six years after the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Rarely a patient may develop varying degrees of bone marrow depression, affecting one or more cell lines, while receiving allopurinol alone. Patients taking allopurinol and mercaptopurine or azathioprine require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects. Patients should be closely monitored for therapeutic response and the appearance of toxicity [see Drug Interaction (7.2) ]. 5.6 Increase in Prothrombin Time It has been reported that allopurinol prolongs the half-life of dicumarol, a coumarin anticoagulant. The prothrombin time should be reassessed periodically in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants (dicumarol, warfarin) concomitantly with DUZALLO [see Drug Interaction (7.2) ]. 5.7 Drowsiness Occasional occurrence of drowsiness was reported in patients taking allopurinol. Patients should be alerted to the need for due caution when engaging in activities where alertness is mandatory [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of DUZALLO is contraindicated in the following conditions: Severe renal impairment (eCLcr less than 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease, kidney transplant recipients, or patients on dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].

Lesinurad in Combination With Allopurinol In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2), a total of 405, 401, and 407 patients with gout were treated with lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, or placebo, respectively, once daily in combination with allopurinol (200 mg to 900 mg daily) for up to 12 months. The majority of patients in these studies received allopurinol daily doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (average dose of allopurinol in the studies was 310 mg), corresponding to the allopurinol doses contained in DUZALLO. The median duration of treatment with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol was 11.2 months. The mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-82), and 95% were males. At baseline, 61% of the patient population showed mild or moderate renal impairment (eCLcr less than 90 mL/min) and 81% of patients had at least one co-morbid condition including hypertension (66%), hyperlipidemia (46%), diabetes (17%), and kidney stones (12%). Renal Events Lesinurad causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, which may lead to renal events including transient increases in serum creatinine, renal-related adverse reactions, and kidney stones. These renal events occurred more frequently in patients receiving lesinurad 400 mg than in patients receiving 200 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The number of patients with serum creatinine elevations in the 12-month placebo-controlled trials in combination with allopurinol is shown in Table 1. Most of these elevations on lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol and lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol resolved without treatment interruption (Table 1).

The incidence of reports of \"blood creatinine increased\" was higher with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol and was highest with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol. Renal-related adverse reactions by baseline renal function category are shown in Table 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Blood creatinine increased occurred more frequently in patients treated with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol across baseline renal function categories (Table 3).

Serious renal-related adverse reactions were reported in patients on lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol (0.7%) and allopurinol alone (0.2%) and in no patients on lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol during the 12-month controlled period of the studies. Serious renal-related adverse reactions were reported with lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol in the uncontrolled long-term extensions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Cardiovascular Safety Cardiovascular events and deaths were adjudicated as Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke) in the Phase 3 randomized controlled studies of lesinurad in combination with allopurinol. In the randomized controlled studies, the numbers of patients with adjudicated MACE (incidences per 100 patient-years of exposure) were: 2 (0.60) for placebo, 2 (0.61) for lesinurad 200 mg, and 6 (1.85) for lesinurad 400 mg when used in combination with allopurinol. Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor were identified in the lesinurad development program. The incidence of these adverse reactions in controlled studies with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol is summarized in Table 4.

Impaired Renal Function The dose of allopurinol sodium for injection should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function to avoid accumulation of allopurinol and its metabolites: Creatinine Clearance Recommended Daily Dose 10 to 20 mL/min 200 mg/day 3 to 10 mL/min 100 mg/day <3 mL/min 100 mg/day at extended intervals Administration In both adults and children, the daily dose can be given as single infusion or in equally divided infusions at 6-, 8-, or 12-hour intervals at the recommended final concentration of not greater than 6 mg/mL (see Preparation of Solution). The rate of infusion depends on the volume of infusate. Whenever possible, therapy with allopurinol sodium for injection should be initiated 24 to 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy known to cause tumor cell lysis (including adrenocorticosteroids). Allopurinol sodium for injection should not be mixed with or administered through the same intravenous port with agents which are incompatible in solution with allopurinol sodium for injection (see Preparation of Solution). Preparation of Solution Allopurinol sodium for injection must be reconstituted and diluted. The contents of each50 mL vial should be dissolved with 25 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. Reconstitution yields a clear, almost colorless solution with no more than a slight opalescence. This concentrated solution has a pH of 11.1 to 11.8. It should be diluted to the desired concentration with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose for Injection. Sodium bicarbonate-containing solutions should not be used. A final concentration of no greater than 6 mg/mL is recommended. The solution should be stored at 20 to 25C (68 to 77F) and administration should begin within 10 hours after reconstitution. Do not refrigerate the reconstituted and/or diluted product. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use this product if particulate matter or discoloration is present. The following table lists drugs that are physically incompatible in solution with allopurinol sodium for injection.

(1.1, 14) Important Limitation of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1.2) 1.1 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy ACTOS is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 1.2 Important Limitation of Use ACTOS exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. ACTOS should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.2) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt ACTOS and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart ACTOS if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.4) Bladder cancer: Preclinical and clinical trial data, and results from an observational study suggest an increased risk of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users. The observational data further suggest that the risk increases with duration of use. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer (5.5) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.6) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.7) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ACTOS or any other anti-diabetic drug. (5.9) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when ACTOS is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with ACTOS than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, ACTOS should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with ACTOS should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking ACTOS, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the ACTOS controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating ACTOS therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, ACTOS should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), ACTOS treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. ACTOS should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on ACTOS. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ACTOS can be used with caution. 5.4 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to ACTOS (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for ACTOS versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with ACTOS (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with ACTOS and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.5 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which ACTOS was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking ACTOS compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking ACTOS. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on ACTOS and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. A five-year interim report of an ongoing 10-year observational cohort study found a non-significant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed to ACTOS, compared to subjects never exposed to ACTOS (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 1.5]). Compared to never exposure, a duration of ACTOS therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk (HR 1.4 [95% CI 0.9 2.1]), which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months of ACTOS use (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.03 2.0]). Interim results from this study suggested that taking ACTOS longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40% which equates to an absolute increase of 3 cases in 10,000 (from approximately 7 in 10,000 [without ACTOS] to approximately 10 in 10,000 [with ACTOS]). There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, ACTOS should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with ACTOS should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving ACTOS in combination with insulin or other anti-diabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant anti-diabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking ACTOS or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Ovulation Therapy with ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking ACTOS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials, so the frequency of this occurrence is not known. Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with ACTOS is recommended. 5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ACTOS or any other anti-diabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not initiate in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with ACTOS in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with ACTOS in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with ACTOS for 6 months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with ACTOS for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with ACTOS for at least 2 years. In six pooled 16 to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16 to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with ACTOS and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with ACTOS than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with ACTOS and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with ACTOS and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of ACTOS on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with ACTOS and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between ACTOS and placebo for the 3-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with ACTOS. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9: PROactive: Number of First and Total Events for Each Component within the Cardiovascular Composite Endpoint Cardiovascular Events Placebo N=2633 ACTOS N=2605 First Events n (%) Total events n First Events n (%) Total events n CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; PCI = percutaneous intervention Any event 572 (21.7) 900 514 (19.7) 803 All-cause mortality 122 (4.6) 186 110 (4.2) 177 Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) 118 (4.5) 157 105 (4.0) 131 Stroke 96 (3.6) 119 76 (2.9) 92 Acute coronary syndrome 63 (2.4) 78 42 (1.6) 65 Cardiac intervention (CABG/PCI) 101 (3.8) 240 101 (3.9) 195 Major leg amputation 15 (0.6) 28 9 (0.3) 28 Leg revascularization 57 (2.2) 92 71 (2.7) 115 Weight Gain: Dose-related weight gain occurs when ACTOS is used alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic medications. The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with ACTOS and placebo in the 16 to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16 to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of ACTOS is provided in Table 12.

One randomized, double-blind, 3-year trial comparing ACTOS to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every 8 weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with ACTOS and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values >3 times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with ACTOS in the ACTOS controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT > 3 times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia: In the ACTOS clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with ACTOS 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with ACTOS 15 mg, 15.4% with ACTOS 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with ACTOS 45 mg compared to ACTOS 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving ACTOS 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving ACTOS 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or ACTOS 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors: Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which ACTOS was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking ACTOS compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking ACTOS. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on ACTOS and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects: ACTOS may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with ACTOS compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with ACTOS therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase: During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in ACTOS clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in 9 (0.2%) patients treated with ACTOS (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive ACTOS, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued ACTOS due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to ACTOS therapy is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ACTOS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with ACTOS, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiate ACTOS at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. Limit initial dose to 15 mg once daily in patients with NYHA Class I or II heart failure. (2.1) If there is inadequate glycemic control, the dose can be increased in 15 mg increments up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily. (2.1) The maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg once daily in patients taking strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil). (2.3, 7.1) Obtain liver tests before starting ACTOS. If abnormal, use caution when treating with ACTOS, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on ACTOS is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.3) 2.1 Recommendations for all patients ACTOS should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals. The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c. After initiation of ACTOS or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating ACTOS. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with ACTOS is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of ACTOS or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking ACTOS should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Concomitant use with an insulin secretagogue or insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered ACTOS and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered ACTOS and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Coadministration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3115035},{"uuid":"71335-0088","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pioglitazone","proprietaryName":"Bryant Ranch Prepack","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Pioglitazone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings [see Clinical Studies (14) ].

(1, 14) Important Limitation of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.2) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone hydrochloride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found.(5.3) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.4) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur.(5.5) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health.(5.6) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.7) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.8) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone hydrochloride, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone hydrochloride is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone tablets must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have beenpostmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone tables, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients withtype 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone tablets therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone tablets can be used with caution. 5.4 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone hydrochloride. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.591.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone hydrochloride, while others did. A large prospective10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.891.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone hydrochloride and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.222.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone hydrochloride and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone hydrochloride may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone hydrochloride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone hydrochloride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.5 Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone hydrochloride, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1 )]. 5.6 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone tablets (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone tablets versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone tablets (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone hydrochloride or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone tablets in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone tablets in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone tablets than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone hydrochloride on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone hydrochloride and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone hydrochloride. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9. PROactive: Number of First and Total Events for Each Component within the Cardiovascular Composite Endpoint Cardiovascular Events Placebo N=2633 Pioglitazone Hydrochloride N=2605 First Events n (%) Total events n First Events n (%) Total events n Any event 572 (21.7) 900 514 (19.7) 803 All-cause mortality 122 (4.6) 186 110 (4.2) 177 Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) 118 (4.5) 157 105 (4.0) 131 Stroke 96 (3.6) 119 76 (2.9) 92 Acute coronary syndrome 63 (2.4) 78 42 (1.6) 65 Cardiac intervention (CABG/PCI) 101 (3.8) 240 101 (3.9) 195 Major leg amputation 15 (0.6) 28 9 (0.3) 28 Leg revascularization 57 (2.2) 92 71 (2.7) 115 CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; PCI = percutaneous intervention Weight Gain: Dose-related weight gain occurs when pioglitazone hydrochloride is used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications. The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone hydrochloride and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

Edema: Edema induced from taking pioglitazone hydrochloride is reversible when pioglitazone hydrochloride is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone tablets is provided in Table 12. Table 12.

One randomized, double-blind, 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone hydrochloride to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater thanthree times the upper limit of the reference range, measured everyeight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every twelve weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater thanthree times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater thanthree times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater thantwo times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone hydrochloride 15 mg, 15.4% with Pioglitazone Hydro chloride 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone hydrochloride 45 mg compared to pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone hydrochloride. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone hydrochloride may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in 9 (0.2%) patients treated with Pioglitazone Hydro chloride (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone hydrochloride, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued Pioglitazone Hydro chloride due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiate pioglitazone tablets at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. Limit initial dose to 15 mg once daily in patients with NYHA Class I or II heart failure. (2.1) If there is inadequate glycemic control, the dose can be increased in 15 mg increments up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily. (2.1) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.3) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals. The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c. After initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warningand Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone hydrochloride and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone hydrochloride and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration ofpioglitazone hydrochloride and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablet is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].","activeIngredient":3097260},{"uuid":"63187-746","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"PIOGLITAZONEHYDROCHLORIDE","proprietaryName":"Proficient Rx LP","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pioglitazone tablets, USP are a thiazolidinedione and an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings.

Pioglitazone tablets, USP should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.2) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone hydrochloride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone hydrochloride if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) Bladder cancer: Preclinical and clinical trial data, and results from an observational study suggest an increased risk of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users. The observational data further suggest that the risk increases with duration of use. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer (5.4) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.5) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.6) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.7) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.9) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone hydrochloride, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone hydrochloride is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone hydrochloride must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone hydrochloride can be used with caution. 5.4 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which pioglitazone hydrochloride was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone hydrochloride. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. A five-year interim report of an ongoing 10-year observational cohort study found a nonsignificant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride, compared to subjects never exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 1.5]). Compared to never exposure, a duration of pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk (HR 1.4 [95% CI 0.9 2.1]), which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months of pioglitazone hydrochloride use (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.03 2.0]). Interim results from this study suggested that taking pioglitazone hydrochloride longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40% which equates to an absolute increase of three cases in 10,000 (from approximately seven in 10,000 [without pioglitazone hydrochloride] to approximately 10 in 10,000 [with pioglitazone hydrochloride]). There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone hydrochloride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone hydrochloride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.5 Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone hydrochloride, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.6 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone hydrochloride versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone hydrochloride or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Ovulation Therapy with pioglitazone hydrochloride, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking pioglitazone hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials, so the frequency of this occurrence is not known. Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride is recommended. 5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning] .

Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone hydrochloride than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone hydrochloride on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone hydrochloride and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone hydrochloride. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone hydrochloride and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

Table13.AdverseEventsofEdemainPatientsinthePROactiveTrial Number(%)ofPatients Placebo N=2633 PioglitazoneHydrochloride N=2605 419(15.9%) 712(27.3%) Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone hydrochloride to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone hydrochloride 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone hydrochloride 45 mg compared to pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which pioglitazone hydrochloride was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone hydrochloride. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone hydrochloride may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone hydrochloride, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone hydrochloride due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiate pioglitazone tablets at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily.

(2.1) If there is inadequate glycemic control, the dose can be increased in 15 mg increments up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily. (2.1) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.3) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals. The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c. After initiation of pioglitazone tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone tablets and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone tablets and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablets is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3102418},{"uuid":"70882-105","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pioglitazone and metformin","proprietaryName":"Cambridge Therapeutics Technologies, LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and biguanide combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate. (1, 14) Important Limitations of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Lactic acidosis: Warn against excessive alcohol intake. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in renal impairment. Ensure normal renal function before initiating and at least annually thereafter. (5.2, 5.10) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: Preclinical and clinical trial data, and results from an observational study suggest an increased risk of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users. The observational data further suggest that the risk increases with duration of use. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.7) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.8) Temporarily discontinue in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. (5.12) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.14) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.15) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered [see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis Metformin hydrochloride Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years. In more than 20,000 patient-years, exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13)]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. Patients should be educated to promptly report these symptoms should they occur. If present, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until lactic acidosis is ruled out. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to recur. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10)]. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10)]. 5.3 Edema In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1), and PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1) ]. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)]. Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanineaminotransferase [ALT], aspartateaminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride can be used with caution. Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3,656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3,679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. A five-year interim report of an ongoing 10-year observational cohort study found a nonsignificant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to subjects never exposed to pioglitazone (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.5]). Compared to never exposure, a duration of pioglitazone therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk (HR 1.4 [95% CI 0.9 to 2.1]), which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months of pioglitazone use (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.03 to 2]). Interim results from this study suggested that taking pioglitazone longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40%, which equates to an absolute increase of 3 cases in 10,000 (from approximately 7 in 10,000 [without pioglitazone] to approximately 10 in 10,000 [with pioglitazone]). There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2,605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2,633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.8 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ]. 5.9 Ovulation Therapy with pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials, so the frequency of this occurrence is not known. Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is recommended. 5.10 Monitoring of Renal Function Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Therefore, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Before initiation of therapy with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated (e.g., elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. Use of Concomitant Medications That May Affect Renal Function or Metformin Disposition Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, should be used with caution [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Radiological Studies and Surgical Procedures Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal. 5.11 Hypoxic States Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued. 5.12 Surgical Procedures Use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. 5.13 Alcohol Intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. 5.14 Vitamin B12</sub Levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful. 5.15 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or any other oral antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

Pioglitazone Over 8,500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2,605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for 6 months or longer, over 4,500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least 2 years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the 3-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10, 11, and 12 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials, the PROactive trial., and the 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride trial.

Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. In the 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride trial, edema was reported in 3.0% of patients in the pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride group, 4.2% in the pioglitazone monotherapy group, and 1.4% in the metformin monotherapy group. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 13. Table 13.

One randomized, double-blind, 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every 8 weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1,051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1,046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patients usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]. In two 3-year trials in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3,656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3,679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality. Metformin hydrochloride In a double-blind clinical study of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin patients, and that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 15. In this trial, diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin. Table 15. Most Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) in a Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Monotherapy Reactions that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients. Adverse Reaction Metformin Monotherapy (n=141) Placebo (n=145) % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 Abdominal Discomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Vitamin B12 Concentrations Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.14)]. CreatinePhosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in 9 (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Pioglitazone The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ].","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets based on the patient's current regimen. (2) May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg. (2) Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. (2) Dose increases should be accompanied by careful monitoring for adverse events related to fluid retention. (2) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible), and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.5) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin. Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given 3 times a day. After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartateaminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ].","activeIngredient":3126793},{"uuid":"42291-512","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pioglitazone and Metformin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"AvKARE, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [ see Clinical Studies ( 14) ].

( 1, 14) Important Limitations of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. ( 1) Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) ].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.1) Lactic acidosis: Warn against excessive alcohol intake. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in hepatic impairment and are contraindicated in renal impairment. Ensure normal renal function before initiating and at least annually thereafter. ( 5.2, 5.10) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. ( 5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. ( 5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.5) Bladder cancer: Preclinical and clinical trial data, and results from an observational study suggest an increased risk of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users. The observational data further suggest that the risk increases with duration of use. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. ( 5.6) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. ( 5.7) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. ( 5.8) Temporarily discontinue in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. ( 5.12) Vitamin B 12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. ( 5.14) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or any other antidiabetic drug. ( 5.15) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets must be considered [ see Boxed Warning, Contraindications ( 4), and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) ]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis Metformin hydrochloride Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years. In more than 20,000 patient-years, exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13) ]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. Patients should be educated to promptly report these symptoms should they occur. If present, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until lactic acidosis is ruled out. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to recur. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10) ]. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery [ see Contraindications ( 4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10) ]. 5.3 Edema In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) ]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), and Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1) ]. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) ]. Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [ ( )]. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause.

There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy.

In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets can be used with caution. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets can be used with caution. Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

In two 3 year trials in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1) ]. In two 3 year trials in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. A five-year interim report of an ongoing 10 year observational cohort study found a nonsignificant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to subjects never exposed to pioglitazone (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.5]). Compared to never exposure, a duration of pioglitazone therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk (HR 1.4 [95% CI 0.9 to 2.1]), which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months of pioglitazone use (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.03 to 2.0]). Interim results from this study suggested that taking pioglitazone longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40%, which equates to an absolute increase of three cases in 10,000 (from approximately seven in 10,000 [without pioglitazone] to approximately 10 in 10,000 [with pioglitazone]).

There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.

During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.8 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) ]. 5.9 Ovulation Therapy with pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1) ]. This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials, so the frequency of this occurrence is not known. Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is recommended. 5.10 Monitoring of Renal Function Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Therefore, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Before initiation of therapy with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated (e.g., elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. Use of Concomitant Medications That May Affect Renal Function or Metformin Disposition Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, should be used with caution [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. Radiological Studies and Surgical Procedures Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin [ see Contraindications ( 4) ]. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal. 5.11 Hypoxic States Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued. 5.12 Surgical Procedures Use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. 5.13 Alcohol Intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. 5.14 Vitamin B 12</sub Levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B 12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful. 5.15 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or any other oral antidiabetic drug. There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or any other oral antidiabetic drug.

Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16 to 24 week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.02; p = 0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16 to 26 week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16 to 24 week combination add-on therapy trials and the PROactive trial.

Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 13. Table 13: Adverse Events of Edema in Patients Treated With Pioglitazone Number (%) of Patients Placebo Pioglitazone 15 mg Pioglitazone 30 mg Pioglitazone 45 mg Monotherapy (16 to 26 weeks) 3 (1.2%) N = 259 2 (2.5%) N = 81 13 (4.7%) N = 275 11 (6.5%) N = 169 Combined Therapy (16 to 24 weeks) Sulfonylurea 4 (2.1%) N = 187 3 (1.6%) N = 184 61 (11.3%) N = 540 81 (23.1%) N = 351 Metformin 4 (2.5%) N = 160 N/A 34 (5.9%) N = 579 58 (13.9%) N = 416 Insulin 13 (7.0%) N = 187 24 (12.6%) N = 191 109 (20.5%) N = 533 90 (26.1%) N = 345 Note: The preferred terms of edema peripheral, generalized edema, pitting edema and fluid retention were combined to form the aggregate term of edema.

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16 week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patients usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n = 2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n = 12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1) ]. In two 3 year trials in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality. Metformin hydrochloride In a double-blind clinical study of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin patients, and that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 15. In this trial, diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin. Table 15: Most Common Adverse Reactions (> 5.0%) in a Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Monotherapy Reactions that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients. Adverse Reaction Metformin Monotherapy (n = 141) Placebo (n = 145) % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 Abdominal Discomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Vitamin B 12 Concentrations Metformin may lower serum vitamin B 12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14) ]. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Pioglitazone The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8) ]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) ]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ].","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets based on the patients current regimen. ( 2) May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg. ( 2) Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. ( 2) Dose increases should be accompanied by careful monitoring for adverse events related to fluid retention. ( 2) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. ( 5.5) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability. for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin. Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day. After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 2.2 Concomitant Use With an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Concomitant Use With Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3 fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ].","activeIngredient":3111208},{"uuid":"64764-254","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"OSENI","proprietaryName":"Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OSENI is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

(1.1) 1.1 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy OSENI is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both alogliptin and pioglitazone is appropriate [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Important Limitations of Use OSENI is not indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Consider the risks and benefits of OSENI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure. Monitor patients at risk for heart failure for signs and symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of OSENI. (5.1) Acute pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue OSENI. (5.2) Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In such cases, promptly discontinue OSENI, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.3) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt OSENI and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart OSENI if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found. Use with caution in patients with liver disease. (5.4) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.5) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.6) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.7) Hypoglycemia: When an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin is used in combination with OSENI, a lower dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.8) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.9) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue if appropriate. (5.10) Bullous pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue OSENI. (5.11) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with OSENI. (5.12) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Consider the risks and benefits of OSENI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of congestive heart failure and should be instructed to immediately report such symptoms. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of OSENI. Alogliptin In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, acute pancreatitis was reported in six (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and two (<0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in ten (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in seven (0.3%) patients treated with placebo. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using OSENI. After initiation of OSENI, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, OSENI should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue OSENI, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with OSENI. 5.4 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. In glycemic control trials of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating OSENI therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, OSENI should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), OSENI treatment should be interrupted and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. OSENI should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. 5.5 Edema Pioglitazone In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. OSENI should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, OSENI should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with OSENI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.6 Fractures Pioglitazone In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Urinary Bladder Tumors Pioglitazone Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.59-1.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective10 year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.891.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22-2.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10 year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, OSENI should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with OSENI should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.8 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with OSENI. 5.9 Macular Edema Pioglitazone Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.11 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving OSENI. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, OSENI should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 5.12 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with OSENI.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin or pioglitazone, components of OSENI, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions.

Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Over 1500 patients with type 2 diabetes have received alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in four large, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. The mean exposure to OSENI was 29 weeks with more than 100 subjects treated for more than one year. The studies consisted of two placebo-controlled studies of 16 to 26 weeks in duration and two active-controlled studies of 26 weeks and 52 weeks in duration. In the OSENI arm, the mean duration of diabetes was approximately six years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2 (54% of patients had a BMI 30 kg/m2), and the mean age was 54 years (16% of patients 65 years of age). In a pooled analysis of these four controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 65% in patients treated with OSENI compared to 57% treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 2.5% with OSENI compared to 2.0% with placebo, 3.7% with pioglitazone or 1.3% with alogliptin. Adverse reactions reported in 4% of patients treated with OSENI and more frequently than in patients who received alogliptin, pioglitazone or placebo are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in 4% of Patients Treated with OSENI and More Frequently than in Patients Receiving Either Alogliptin, Pioglitazone or Placebo Number of Patients (%) OSENIOSENI includes data pooled for patients receiving alogliptin 25 mg and 12.5 mg combined with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg AlogliptinAlogliptin includes data pooled for patients receiving alogliptin 25 mg and 12.5 mg PioglitazonePioglitazone includes data pooled for patients receiving pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg Placebo N=1533 N=446 N=949 N=153 Nasopharyngitis 75 (4.9) 21 (4.7) 37 (3.9) 6 (3.9) Back Pain 64 (4.2) 9 (2.0) 32 (3.4) 5 (3.3) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 63 (4.1) 19 (4.3) 26 (2.7) 5 (3.3) Alogliptin Add-On Therapy to a Thiazolidinedione In addition, in a 26 week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, patients inadequately controlled on a thiazolidinedione alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea were treated with add-on alogliptin therapy or placebo; the adverse reactions reported in 5% of patients and more frequently than in patients who received placebo was influenza (alogliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 4.1%). Hypoglycemia In a 26 week, placebo-controlled factorial study with alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone on background therapy with metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 0.8%, 0% and 3.8% for alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; 2.3% for alogliptin 25 mg; 4.7%, 0.8% and 0.8% for pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; and 0.8% for placebo. In a 26 week, active-controlled, double-blind study with alogliptin alone, pioglitazone alone or alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 3% on alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg, 0.6% on alogliptin 25 mg and 1.8% on pioglitazone 30 mg. In a 52 week, active-controlled, double-blind study of alogliptin as add-on therapy to the combination of pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin compared to the titration of pioglitazone 30 mg to 45 mg and metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 4.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin group versus 1.5% in the pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin group. Alogliptin A total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 14 randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials of whom 9052 subjects were treated with alogliptin, 3469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2257 were treated with an active comparator. The mean duration of diabetes was seven years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2 (49% of patients had a BMI 30 kg/m2) and the mean age was 58 years (26% of patients 65 years of age). The mean exposure to alogliptin was 49 weeks with 3348 subjects treated for more than one year. In a pooled analysis of these 14 controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 73% in patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 75% with placebo and 70% with active comparator. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 6.8% with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 8.4% with placebo or 6.2% with active comparator. Adverse reactions reported in 4% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in 4% Patients Treated with Alogliptin 25 mg and More Frequently than in Patients Given Placebo in Pooled Studies Number of Patients (%) Alogliptin 25 mg Placebo Active Comparator N=6447 N=3469 N=2257 Nasopharyngitis 309 (4.8) 152 (4.4) 113 (5.0) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 287 (4.5) 121 (3.5) 113 (5.0) Headache 278 (4.3) 101 (2.9) 121 (5.4) Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemic events were documented based upon a blood glucose value and/or clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In the monotherapy study, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 1.5% in patients treated with alogliptin compared to 1.6% with placebo. The use of alogliptin as add-on therapy to glyburide or insulin did not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia compared to placebo. In a monotherapy study comparing alogliptin to a sulfonylurea in elderly patients, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 5.4% with alogliptin compared to 26% with glipizide. In the EXAMINE trial, the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia was 6.7% in patients receiving alogliptin and 6.5% in patients receiving placebo. Serious adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Renal Impairment In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, 3.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and 1.3% of patients treated with placebo had renal function adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.1% for active comparators or placebo), decreased creatinine clearance (1.6% for alogliptin and 0.5% for active comparators or placebo) and increased blood creatinine (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.3% for active comparators or placebo) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In the EXAMINE trial of high CV risk type 2 diabetes patients, 23% of patients treated with alogliptin and 21% of patients treated with placebo had an investigator reported renal impairment adverse reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (7.7% for alogliptin and 6.7% for placebo), decreased glomerular filtration rate (4.9% for alogliptin and 4.3% for placebo) and decreased renal clearance (2.2% for alogliptin and 1.8% for placebo). Laboratory measures of renal function were also assessed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 25% or more in 21.1% of patients treated with alogliptin and 18.7% of patients treated with placebo. Worsening of chronic kidney disease stage was seen in 16.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 15.5% of patients treated with placebo. Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. Common Adverse Reactions: 16 to 26 Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse reactions reported in three pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 3. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of >5% and more commonly in patients treated with pioglitazone than in patients who received placebo. None of these adverse reactions were related to pioglitazone dose. Table 3.

None of the reactions were fatal. Patients with type 2 diabetes and NYHA class II or early class III congestive heart failure were randomized to receive 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pioglitazone at daily doses of 30 mg to 45 mg (N=262) or glyburide at daily doses of 10 mg to 15 mg (N=256). A summary of the incidence of adverse reactions related to congestive heart failure reported in this study is provided in Table 4. Table 4.

Table 5. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in PROactive Trial Number (%) of Patients Placebo N=2633 Pioglitazone N=2605 At least one hospitalized congestive heart failure event 108 (4.1%) 149 (5.7%) Fatal 22 (0.8%) 25 (1%) Hospitalized, nonfatal 86 (3.3%) 124 (4.7%) Cardiovascular Safety In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years and mean A1C of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 6. Table 6.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with finger stick glucose testing. In the 16 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16 week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (N=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (N=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Pioglitazone Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Alogliptin The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of alogliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatic enzyme elevations, fulminant hepatic failure, severe and disabling arthralgia and bullous pemphigoid , diarrhea, constipation, nausea and ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.10, 5.11)]. Pioglitazone The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","drugClass":"alogliptin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of OSENI based on the patient's current regimen and concurrent medical condition but do not exceed a daily dose of alogliptin 25 mg and pioglitazone 45 mg.

(2.2) The maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg once daily in patients taking strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil). (2.3, 7.1) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients OSENI should be taken once daily and can be taken with or without food. The tablets must not be split before swallowing. The recommended starting dose for OSENI (alogliptin and pioglitazone): for patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients on alogliptin who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients on pioglitazone who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg, 25 mg/30 mg or 25 mg/45 mg as appropriate based upon current therapy, for patients switching from alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone, OSENI may be initiated at the dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone based upon current therapy, for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 25 mg/15 mg. The OSENI dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg/45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by hemoglobin A1c (A1C). After initiation of OSENI or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention as has been seen with pioglitazone (e.g., weight gain, edema and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure) [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of OSENI is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 60 mL/min). The dose of OSENI is 12.5 mg/15 mg, 12.5 mg/30 mg or 12.5 mg/45 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <60 mL/min). OSENI is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of pioglitazone and alogliptin 6.25 mg once daily based on individual requirements may be considered in these patients. Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of OSENI therapy and periodically thereafter. 2.3 Coadministration with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately three-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of OSENI is 25 mg/15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3114263},{"uuid":"65862-525","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pioglitazone Hydrochloride and Metformin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Aurobindo Pharma Limited","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Lactic acidosis: See boxed warning.(5.2) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.7) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.8) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.9) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. (5.10) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride must be considered [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis Metformin hydrochloride Lactic Acidosis There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio;metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. In pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patients renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Before initiating pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an eGFR. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g., cationic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.3 Edema In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]. Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride can be used with caution. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1; [95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89 to 1.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22 to 2.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.8 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.9 Vitamin B12</sub Levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful. 5.10 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Common Adverse Events: 16- to 26-Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse events reported in three pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 1.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.02; p=0.1). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10, 11, and 12 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials, the PROactive trial, and the 24-week pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride trial.

Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. In the 24-week pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride trial, edema was reported in 3% of patients in the pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride group, 4.2% in the pioglitazone monotherapy group, and 1.4% in the metformin monotherapy group. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 13. Table 13.

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patients usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Metformin hydrochloride In a double-blind clinical study of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin patients, and that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 15. In this trial, diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin. Table 15. Most Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) in a Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Monotherapy* Adverse Reaction Metformin Monotherapy (n=141) Placebo (n=145) % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 Abdominal Discomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 *Reactions that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Vitamin B12 Concentrations Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Pioglitazone New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [seeBoxed Warningand Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Metformin Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury.","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose based on the patient's current regimen and adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg.

Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets maybe titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin. Metformin doses above 2000 mg maybe better tolerated giventhree times a day. After initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tabletsor with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [seeContraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredientsin pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [seeDrug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

(1) Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Lactic acidosis: See boxed warning. (5.2) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.7) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.8) Vitamin B12deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.9) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.10) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis Metformin hydrochloride Lactic Acidosis There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio;metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an eGFR. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g. cationic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.3 Edema In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride can be used with caution. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% Cl: 0.59 to 1.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective 10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% Cl 0.89 to 1.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% Cl: 1.22 to 2.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.8 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.9 Vitamin B12 Levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful. 5.10 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or any other oral antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning] .

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Lactic acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add- on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Common Adverse Events: 16- to 26-Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse events reported in three pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 1. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of >5% and more commonly in patients treated with pioglitazone than in patients who received placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9 .

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10, 11, and 12 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24 week combination add-on therapy trials, the PROactive trial, and 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride trial.

The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. In the 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets trial, edema was reported in 3.0% of patients in the pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets group, 4.2% in the pioglitazone monotherapy group, and 1.4% in the metformin monotherapy group. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 13. Table 13 .

Adverse Events of Edema in Patients in the PROactive Trial Number (%) of Patients Placebo N=2633 Pioglitazone N=2605 419(15.9%) 712(27.3%) Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% Cl: 0.59 to 1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Metformin hydrochloride In a double-blind clinical study of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin patients, and that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 15. In this trial, diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin. Table 15 . Most Common Adverse Reactions (> 5 . 0 %) in a Placebo - Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Monotherapy * Metformin Monotherapy (n=141) Placebo (n=145) Adverse Reaction % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 AbdominalDiscomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Vitamin B12 Concentrations Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator- treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Pioglitazone The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume- related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","drugClass":"metformin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose based on the patient's current regimen and adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg. (2.1) Give in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal effects due to metformin. (2.1) Monitor patients for adverse events related to fluid retention after initiation and dose increases. (2.1) Obtain liver tests before initiation. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible), and follow appropriately. (2.1, 5.5) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (2.2) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Assess risk/benefit of continuing pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures (2.4) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin. Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day. After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2is not recommended. In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedures in patients with eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","activeIngredient":3111341},{"uuid":"33342-176","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pioglitazole and metformin hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and biguanide combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate. (1, 14) Important Limitation of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Lactic acidosis: : See boxed warning(5.2) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.7) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.9) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.10) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis Metformin hydrochloride Lactic Acidosis There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio;metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an eGFR. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30mL/min /1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g. cationic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.3 Edema In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]. Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets can be used with caution. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up,the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.591.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.891.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.222.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in theU.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.8 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.9 Vitamin B12 Levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful. 5.10 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10, 11, and 12 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, doubleblind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials, the PROactive trial, and the 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride trial.

Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. In the 24-week pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride trial, edema was reported in 3.0% of patients in the pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride group, 4.2% in the pioglitazone monotherapy group and 1.4% in the metformin monotherapy group. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 13. Table 13.

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Metformin hydrochloride In a double-blind clinical study of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin patients, and that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 15. In this trial, diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin. Table 15. Most Common Adverse Reactions (>5.0%) in a Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Monotherapy* Adverse Reaction Metformin Monotherapy (n=141) Placebo (n=145) % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 Abdominal Discomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 * Reactions that were more common in metformin than placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Vitamin B12 Concentrations Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing, and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Metformin Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury.","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose based on the patient's current regimen and adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg.

If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible), and follow appropriately. (2.1, 5.5) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (2.2) oDo not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 oInitiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 oAssess risk/benefit of continuing Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 oDiscontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures (2.4) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin. Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day. After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablet is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablet or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablet is 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and ClinicalPharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and a sulfonylurea combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and glimepiride is appropriate. (1) Important Limitations of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: May be severe. When insulin or an insulin secretagogue is used with pioglitazone, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.2) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Postmarketing reports for glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride, include anaphylaxis, angioedema and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Promptly discontinue pioglitazone and glimepiride, assess for other cases, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.3) Potential increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with sulfonylureas: Inform patients of risk, benefits, and treatment alternatives. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and glimepiride and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and glimepiride if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.7) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.8) Hemolytic anemia: Can occur if glucose 6-phophate dehydrogenase (GP6D) deficient. Use with caution in patients with GP6D deficiency. (5.9) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.10) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and glimepiride or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.11) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone and glimepiride is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and glimepiride must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Glimepiride All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing pioglitazone and glimepiride doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other antidiabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Glimepiride There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue pioglitazone and glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. 5.4 Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas Glimepiride The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride tablets and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.5 Hepatic Effects Pioglitazone There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and glimepiride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and glimepiride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and glimepiride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and glimepiride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride can be used with caution. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Pioglitazone Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.591.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective 10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.891.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI:1.222.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and glimepiride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and glimepiride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Edema Pioglitazone In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Pioglitazone and glimepiride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and glimepiride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and glimepiride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Fractures Pioglitazone In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and glimepiride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.9 Hemolytic Anemia Glimepiride Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets contains glimepiride, which belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a nonsulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Macular Edema Pioglitazone Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patients underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and glimepiride or any other antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

The adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in the controlled 16-week clinical studies between placebo plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone (15 mg and 30 mg combined) plus sulfonylurea treatment arms were upper respiratory tract infection (15.5% and 16.6%), accidental injury (8.6% and 3.5%), and combined edema/peripheral edema (2.1% and 7.2%), respectively. The incidence and type of adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in any combined treatment group from the 24-week study comparing pioglitazone 30 mg plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone 45 mg plus a sulfonylurea are shown in Table 1; the rate of adverse events resulting in study discontinuation between the two treatment groups was 6% and 9.7%, respectively.

Pioglitazone Over 8,500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2,605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4,500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514(19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 7. Table 7.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 8 and 9 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 10. Table 10.

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eightweeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patients usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (N=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (N=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6(0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Glimepiride Adverse events that occurred in controlled clinical trials with placebo and glimepiride monotherapy, other than hypoglycemia, included: headache (7.8% and 8.2%), accidental injury (3.4% and 5.8%), flu syndrome (4.4% and 5.4%), nausea (3.4% and 5 %) and dizziness (2.4% and 5 %), respectively. Hypoglycemia In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Final daily doses of glimepiride were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (as defined above for the 14-week trial) for glimepiride versus placebo was 19.7% vs. 3.2%. All of these events were self-treated. Weight Gain Glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain. Allergic Reactions In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of glimepiride-treated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions (e.g., dyspnea, hypotension, shock) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Laboratory Tests Elevated Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) In 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride, 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients developed serum ALT greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range. Laboratory Abnormalities Pioglitazone Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone and glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Pioglitazone New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Glimepiride Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Impairment of liver function (e.g. with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure. Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions and allergic vasculitis Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia Thrombocytopenia (including severe cases with platelet count less than 10,000/mcL) and thrombocytopenic purpura Hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets based on the patients current regimen. (2.1) May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and glimepiride 8 mg. (2.1) Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be given in a single dose once daily with meals. (2.1) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.5) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be taken once daily with the first main meal. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and glimepiride is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets: pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride already being taken, for patients currently on a different sulfonylurea monotherapy or switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus a different sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide): 30 mg/2 mg once daily and adjusted after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to the potential overlapping drug effect. for patients with systolic dysfunction, the lowest approved dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be prescribed only after titration from 15 mg to 30 mg of pioglitazone has been safely tolerated. After initiation of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for hypoglycemia and adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and an insulin secretagogue, the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If gemfibrozil or other CYP2C8 inhibitors need to coadministered, patients should switch to individual components of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets because the minimum dose of pioglitazone in pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets exceeds 15 mg [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Concomitant Use with Colesevelam When colesevelam is coadministered with glimepiride, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glimepiride is reduced. Therefore, pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be administered at least four hours prior to colesevelam [see Drug Interactions (7.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].","activeIngredient":3105339},{"uuid":"45802-304","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Alogliptin and Pioglitazone","proprietaryName":"Perrigo New York Inc","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets are a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Important Limitations of Use Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets are not indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Consider the risks and benefits of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure. Monitor patients at risk for heart failure for signs and symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. (5.1) Acute pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. (5.2) Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In such cases, promptly discontinue alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.3) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found. Use with caution in patients with liver disease. (5.4) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.5) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.6) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.7) Hypoglycemia: When an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin is used in combination with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, a lower dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.8) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.9) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue if appropriate. (5.10) Bullous pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. (5.11) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. (5.12) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Consider the risks and benefits of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of congestive heart failure and should be instructed to immediately report such symptoms. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. Alogliptin In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, acute pancreatitis was reported in six (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and two (<0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in ten (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in seven (0.3%) patients treated with placebo. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. After initiation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. 5.4 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. In glycemic control trials of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets treatment should be interrupted and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. 5.5 Edema Pioglitazone In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.6 Fractures Pioglitazone In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Urinary Bladder Tumors Pioglitazone Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to ten additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.591.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective ten year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.891.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.222.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the ten year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.8 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. 5.9 Macular Edema Pioglitazone Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.11 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 5.12 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin or pioglitazone, components of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions.

Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Over 1500 patients with type 2 diabetes have received alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in four large, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. The mean exposure to alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets was 29 weeks with more than 100 subjects treated for more than one year. The studies consisted of two placebo-controlled studies of 16 to 26 weeks in duration and two active-controlled studies of 26 weeks and 52 weeks in duration. In the alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets arm, the mean duration of diabetes was approximately six years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2 (54% of patients had a BMI 30 kg/m2), and the mean age was 54 years (16% of patients 65 years of age). In a pooled analysis of these four controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 65% in patients treated with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets compared to 57% treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 2.5% with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets compared to 2.0% with placebo, 3.7% with pioglitazone or 1.3% with alogliptin. Adverse reactions reported in 4% of patients treated with alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets and more frequently than in patients who received alogliptin, pioglitazone or placebo are summarized in Table 1.

Hypoglycemia In a 26 week, placebo-controlled factorial study with alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone on background therapy with metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 0.8%, 0% and 3.8% for alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; 2.3% for alogliptin 25 mg; 4.7%, 0.8% and 0.8% for pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; and 0.8% for placebo. In a 26 week, active-controlled, double-blind study with alogliptin alone, pioglitazone alone or alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 3% on alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg, 0.6% on alogliptin 25 mg and 1.8% on pioglitazone 30 mg. In a 52 week, active-controlled, double-blind study of alogliptin as add-on therapy to the combination of pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin compared to the titration of pioglitazone 30 mg to 45 mg and metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 4.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin group versus 1.5% in the pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin group. Alogliptin A total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 14 randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials of whom 9052 subjects were treated with alogliptin, 3469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2257 were treated with an active comparator. The mean duration of diabetes was seven years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2 (49% of patients had a BMI 30 kg/m2) and the mean age was 58 years (26% of patients 65 years of age). The mean exposure to alogliptin was 49 weeks with 3348 subjects treated for more than one year. In a pooled analysis of these 14 controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 73% in patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 75% with placebo and 70% with active comparator. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 6.8% with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 8.4% with placebo or 6.2% with active comparator. Adverse reactions reported in 4% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in 4% Patients Treated with Alogliptin 25 mg and More Frequently than in Patients Given Placebo in Pooled Studies Number of Patients (%) Alogliptin 25 mg Placebo Active Comparator N=6447 N=3469 N=2257 Nasopharyngitis 309 (4.8) 152 (4.4) 113 (5.0) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 287 (4.5) 121 (3.5) 113 (5.0) Headache 278 (4.3) 101 (2.9) 121 (5.4) Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemic events were documented based upon a blood glucose value and/or clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In the monotherapy study, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 1.5% in patients treated with alogliptin compared to 1.6% with placebo. The use of alogliptin as add-on therapy to glyburide or insulin did not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia compared to placebo. In a monotherapy study comparing alogliptin to a sulfonylurea in elderly patients, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 5.4% with alogliptin compared to 26% with glipizide. In the EXAMINE trial, the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia was 6.7% in patients receiving alogliptin and 6.5% in patients receiving placebo. Serious adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Renal Impairment In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, 3.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and 1.3% of patients treated with placebo had renal function adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.1% for active comparators or placebo), decreased creatinine clearance (1.6% for alogliptin and 0.5% for active comparators or placebo) and increased blood creatinine (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.3% for active comparators or placebo) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In the EXAMINE trial of high CV risk type 2 diabetes patients, 23% of patients treated with alogliptin and 21% of patients treated with placebo had an investigator reported renal impairment adverse reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (7.7% for alogliptin and 6.7% for placebo), decreased glomerular filtration rate (4.9% for alogliptin and 4.3% for placebo) and decreased renal clearance (2.2% for alogliptin and 1.8% for placebo). Laboratory measures of renal function were also assessed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 25% or more in 21.1% of patients treated with alogliptin and 18.7% of patients treated with placebo. Worsening of chronic kidney disease stage was seen in 16.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 15.5% of patients treated with placebo. Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. Common Adverse Reactions: 16 to 26 Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse reactions reported in three pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 3. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of >5% and more commonly in patients treated with pioglitazone than in patients who received placebo. None of these adverse reactions were related to pioglitazone dose. Table 3.

None of the reactions were fatal. Patients with type 2 diabetes and NYHA class II or early class III congestive heart failure were randomized to receive 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pioglitazone at daily doses of 30 mg to 45 mg (N=262) or glyburide at daily doses of 10 mg to 15 mg (N=256). A summary of the incidence of adverse reactions related to congestive heart failure reported in this study is provided in Table 4. Table 4.

Table 5. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in PROactive Trial Number (%) of Patients Placebo N=2633 Pioglitazone N=2605 At least one hospitalized congestive heart failure event 108 (4.1%) 149 (5.7%) Fatal 22 (0.8%) 25 (1%) Hospitalized, nonfatal 86 (3.3%) 124 (4.7%) Cardiovascular Safety In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years and mean A1C of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 6. Table 6.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with finger stick glucose testing. In the 16 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16 week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (N=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (N=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to ten additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Pioglitazone Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than ten times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Alogliptin The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of alogliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatic enzyme elevations, fulminant hepatic failure, severe and disabling arthralgia and bullous pemphigoid, diarrhea, constipation, nausea and ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.10, 5.11)]. Pioglitazone The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","drugClass":"alogliptin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets based on the patient's current regimen and concurrent medical condition but do not exceed a daily dose of alogliptin 25 mg and pioglitazone 45 mg.

(2.2) The maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg once daily in patients taking strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil). (2.3, 7.1) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken with or without food. The tablets must not be split before swallowing. The recommended starting dose for alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets: for patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients on alogliptin who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg, for patients on pioglitazone who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg, 25 mg/30 mg or 25 mg/45 mg as appropriate based upon current therapy, for patients switching from alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets may be initiated at the dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone based upon current therapy, for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 25 mg/15 mg. The alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg/45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by hemoglobin A1c (A1C). After initiation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention as has been seen with pioglitazone (e.g., weight gain, edema and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure) [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 60 mL/min). The dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets is 12.5 mg/15 mg, 12.5 mg/30 mg or 12.5 mg/45 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <60 mL/min). Alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets are not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of pioglitazone and alogliptin 6.25 mg once daily based on individual requirements may be considered in these patients. Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets therapy and periodically thereafter. 2.3 Coadministration with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately three-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets is 25 mg/15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3084290},{"uuid":"66993-822","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"pioglitazone and glimepiride","proprietaryName":"Prasco Laboratories","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or a sulfonylurea alone [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and a sulfonylurea combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and glimepiride is appropriate. (1) Important Limitations of Use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1) Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: May be severe. When insulin or an insulin secretagogue is used with pioglitazone, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.2) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Postmarketing reports for glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, include anaphylaxis, angioedema and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Promptly discontinue pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, assess for other cases, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.3) Potential increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with sulfonylureas: Inform patients of risk, benefits, and treatment alternatives. (5.4) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.5) Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. (5.6) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. (5.7) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. (5.8) Hemolytic anemia: Can occur if glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GP6D) deficient. Use with caution in patients with GP6D deficiency. (5.9) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. (5.10) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. (5.11) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets must be considered [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Glimepiride All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other antidiabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Glimepiride There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. 5.4 Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas Glimepiride The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride tablets and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.5 Hepatic Effects Pioglitazone There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets can be used with caution. 5.6 Urinary Bladder Tumors Pioglitazone Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer . After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.591.72]). Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective 10 year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89-1.26]). A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.222.19]). Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10 year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors.There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.7 Edema Pioglitazone In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Fractures Pioglitazone In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.9 Hemolytic Anemia Glimepiride Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets contain glimepiride, which belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a nonsulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Macular Edema Pioglitazone Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].

The adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in the controlled 16 week clinical studies between placebo plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone (15 mg and 30 mg combined) plus sulfonylurea treatment arms were upper respiratory tract infection (15.5% and 16.6%), accidental injury (8.6% and 3.5%), and combined edema/peripheral edema (2.1% and 7.2%), respectively. The incidence and type of adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in any combined treatment group from the 24 week study comparing pioglitazone 30 mg plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone 45 mg plus a sulfonylurea are shown in Table 1; the rate of adverse events resulting in study discontinuation between the two treatment groups was 6% and 9.7%, respectively.

Pioglitazone Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16 to 24 week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 7. Table 7.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 8 and 9 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16 to 26 week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16 to 24 week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

One randomized, double-blind, 3 year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16 week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (N=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (N=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Glimepiride Adverse events that occurred in controlled clinical trials with placebo and glimepiride monotherapy, other than hypoglycemia, included: headache (7.8% and 8.2%), accidental injury (3.4% and 5.8%), flu syndrome (4.4% and 5.4%), nausea (3.4% and 5.0%) and dizziness (2.4% and 5.0%), respectively. Hypoglycemia In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3 week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 150 mg/dL. Final daily doses of glimepiride were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (as defined above for the 14 week trial) for glimepiride versus placebo was 19.7% vs. 3.2%. All of these events were self-treated. Weight Gain Glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain. Allergic Reactions In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of glimepiride-treated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions (e.g., dyspnea, hypotension, shock) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Laboratory Tests Elevated Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) In 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride, 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients developed serum ALT greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range. Laboratory Abnormalities Pioglitazone Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone and glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Pioglitazone New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Glimepiride Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Impairment of liver function (e.g. with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions and allergic vasculitis Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia Thrombocytopenia (including severe cases with platelet count less than 10,000/mcL) and thrombocytopenic purpura Hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone","drugClass":"pioglitazone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets based on the patient's current regimen. (2.1) May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and glimepiride 8 mg. (2.1) Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be given in a single dose once daily with meals. (2.1) Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.5) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be taken once daily with the first main meal. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and glimepiride is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability, for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets: pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride already being taken, for patients currently on a different sulfonylurea monotherapy or switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus a different sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide): 30 mg/2 mg once daily and adjusted after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to the potential overlapping drug effect. for patients with systolic dysfunction, the lowest approved dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be prescribed only after titration from 15 mg to 30 mg of pioglitazone has been safely tolerated. After initiation of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for hypoglycemia and adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and an insulin secretagogue, the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response. 2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3 fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If gemfibrozil or other CYP2C8 inhibitors need to co-administered, patients should switch to individual components of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets because the minimum dose of pioglitazone in pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets exceeds 15 mg [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Concomitant Use with Colesevelam When colesevelam is coadministered with glimepiride, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glimepiride is reduced.

Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.2) 5.1 Serious Cardiopulmonary Reactions Serious cardiopulmonary reactions including fatalities have occurred uncommonly during or shortly following perflutren-containing microsphere administration, typically within 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). The reported reactions to perflutren-containing microspheres include: fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness and convulsions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to Optison administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions have been observed during or shortly following perflutren-containing microsphere administration including: Shock, hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, throat tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal, mouth, peripheral, localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, tongue upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren-containing microsphere products. Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to Optison administration and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions. 5.3 Systemic Embolization When administering Optison to patients with a cardiac shunt, microspheres can bypass filtering of the lung and enter the arterial circulation. Assess patients with shunts for embolic phenomena following Optison administration. Optison is only for intravenous administration; do not administer Optison by intra-arterial injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.4 Ventricular Arrhythmia Related to High Mechanical Index High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias. Optison is not recommended for use at mechanical indices greater than 0.8. 5.5 Transmissible Infectious Agents This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral disease. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote.

Optison was administered in clinical studies in 279 patients. Of these patients there were 192 (68.8%) men and 87 (31.2%) women. The racial demographics were 199 (71.3%) Caucasian, 52 (18.6%) Black, 24 (8.6%) Hispanic, and 4 (1.4%) other racial or ethnic groups. In these patients, 47 (16.8%) reported at least one adverse reaction. Of these one reaction was serious and required treatment with antihistamines for hypersensitivity manifestations of dizziness, nausea, flushing and temperature elevation. Deaths were not reported during the clinical studies. Of the reported adverse reactions following the use of Optison the most frequently reported were headache (5.4%), nausea and/or vomiting (4.3%), warm sensation or flushing (3.6%), and dizziness (2.5%).

Of these patients, 648 (62.4%) were male and 391 (37.6%) were female with average age of 59.9 years (min, max: 20, 97). The racial distributions were 864 (83.2%) White, 141 (13.6%) Black, 18 (1.7%) Asian, and 16 (1.5%) other racial or ethnic groups. Overall, 175 patients (16.8%) reported at least one adverse event. No serious adverse reactions, including deaths, were reported in this study. The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of Optison. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac arrests and other serious but non-fatal adverse reactions were uncommonly reported. Most of these reactions included cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs such as cardiac arrest, hypotension, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, respiratory distress or decreased oxygenation.

Administration Instructions (2.3) For intravenous injection. Do not administer by intra-arterial injection (5.3) Injection rate should not exceed 1 mL per second Follow the Optison injection with a flush of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of Optison is 0.5 mL injected into a peripheral vein. If the contrast enhancement is inadequate after the dose of 0.5 mL, additional doses in increments of 0.5 mL may be repeated for further contrast enhancement as needed. The maximum total dose should not exceed 5mL in any 10 minute period. The maximum total dose should not exceed 8.7 mL in any one patient study. 2.2 Preparation Instructions Do not use if the container has been damaged, the protective seal and/or rubber cap have been entered, or the upper white layer is absent (may indicate the microspheres have been damaged and may result in poor or no echo contrast). Invert the Optison vial and gently rotate to resuspend the microspheres. This process will allow the product to come to room temperature before use. Inspect the vial for complete resuspension. Do not use if the solution appears to be clear rather than opaque and milky-white. Vent the Optison vial with a sterile vent spike or with a sterile 18 gauge needle before withdrawing the Optison suspension into the injection syringe. Do not inject air into the vial. Use the product within one minute of suspension. If one minute is exceeded, resuspend by inverting and gently rotating the microsoheres in the syringe. Failure to adequately resuspend Optison may cause inadequate delivery of the microspheres, and may result in inadequate contrast. 2.3 Administration Instructions Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not inject if the solution is not opaque, milky-white, and absent particulate matter. Inject through a 20-gauge or larger angiocatheter into a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 1 mL per second. Suggested methods of administration include: a short extension tubing, heparin lock, or intravenous line, all with a 3-way stopcock. Administer intravenously; do not administer Optison by intra-arterial injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not aspirate blood back into the Optison containing syringe before administration; this may promote the formation of a blood clot within the syringe. For short extension tubing or heparin lock: fill one syringe with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, and FLUSH the line for patency before and after the injection of Optison. For a continuous intravenous line: open an intravenous line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP) at a slow infusion rate to maintain vascular patency. Flush the line immediately after injection of Optison Do not use the single-patient use vial for more than one patient.

The mean age was 56.1 years (range 18 to 93). Of these, 144 (8.4%) had at least one adverse reaction (Table 1). There were 26 serious adverse events and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event. Serious Adverse Reactions Among the 1716 study patients, 19 (1.1%) suffered serious cardiopulmonary adverse reactions. For all adverse reactions, the overall incidence of adverse experiences was similar for the 65 year age group, similar in males and in females, similar among all racial or ethnic groups, and similar for bolus and infusion dosing.

The maximum dose is either two bolus doses or one single intravenous infusion. The recommended bolus dose for activated DEFINITY is 10 microliters (microL)/kg of the activated product by intravenous bolus injection within 30-60 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush. If necessary, a second 10 microliters (microL)/kg dose followed by a second 10 mL saline flush may be administered 30 minutes after the first injection to prolong contrast enhancement. The recommended infusion dose for activated DEFINITY is via an IV infusion of 1.3 mL added to 50 mL of preservative-free saline. The rate of infusion should be initiated at 4.0 mL/minute, but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement, not to exceed 10 mL/minute. 2.1 Important Administration Instructions DEFINITY is intended for administration only after activation in the VIALMIX apparatus. Before injection, this product must be activated and prepared according to the instructions outlined below. The VIALMIX apparatus should be ordered from Lantheus Medical Imaging, 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA, 01862. For customer orders call 1-800-299-3431. DEFINITY may be injected by either an intravenous (IV) bolus or infusion. Do not administer DEFINITY by intra-arterial injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The maximum dose is either two bolus doses or one single intravenous infusion. The safety of bolus and infusion dosing in combination or in sequence, has not been studied. 2.2 Dosage Bolus The recommended bolus dose for activated DEFINITY is 10 microliters (microL)/kg of the activated product by intravenous bolus injection within 30-60 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush. If necessary, a second 10 microliters (microL)/kg dose followed by a second 10 mL saline flush may be administered 30 minutes after the first injection to prolong contrast enhancement. Infusion The recommended infusion dose for activated DEFINITY is via an IV infusion of 1.3 mL added to 50 mL of preservative-free saline. The rate of infusion should be initiated at 4.0 mL/minute, but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement, not to exceed 10 mL/minute. 2.3 Imaging Guidelines After baseline non-contrast echocardiography is completed, set the mechanical index for the ultrasound device at 0.8 or below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Then inject activated DEFINITY (as described above) and begin ultrasound imaging immediately. Evaluate the activated DEFINITY echocardiogram images in combination with the non-contrast echocardiogram images. In a crossover trial of 64 patients randomized to both bolus and infusion, the duration of clinically useful contrast enhancement for fundamental imaging was approximately 3.4 minutes after a 10 microL/kg bolus and was approximately 7.1 minutes during the continuous infusion of 1.3 mL activated DEFINITY in 50 mL saline at a rate of 4 mL/min. 2.4 DEFINITY Activation, Preparation and Handling Instructions Allow the vial to warm to room temperature before starting the activation procedure. Activate DEFINITY by shaking the vial for 45 seconds using a VIALMIX. Note: illustrations of this procedure are contained in the VIALMIX User's Guide. Do not use this drug unless it has completed a full 45 second activation cycle in the VIALMIX. DEFINITY will not be properly activated unless the full 45 second activation cycle is completed. Do not reactivate the vial if VIALMIX did not complete a full 45 second cycle. Do not reactivate a successfully activated DEFINITY vial (see step 3). Do not use a VIALMIX that is not functioning properly. Refer to the VIALMIX User's Guide for the \"VIALMIX calibration and replacement procedures\" to ensure that a properly functioning VIALMIX is used. Immediately after activation in the VIALMIX, activated DEFINITY appears as a milky white suspension and may be used immediately after activation. If the product is not used within 5 minutes of VIALMIX activation, the microspheres should be resuspended by 10 seconds of hand agitation by inverting the vial before the product is withdrawn in a syringe. The activated DEFINITY may be used for up to 12 hours from the time of VIALMIX, but only after the microspheres are resuspended by hand agitation. Store the activated DEFINITY at room temperature in the original product vial. Invert the vial and withdraw the activated milky white suspension using the Intellipin (Dispensing Pin), the PINSYNC (Vented Vial Adapter 13mm), or 18 to 20 gauge syringe needle. Withdraw the material from the middle of the liquid in the inverted vial. Do not inject air into the DEFINITY Vial. Use the product immediately after its withdrawal from the vial; do not allow the product to stand in the syringe. For single use only: DEFINITY does not contain bacterial preservative. Bacterial contamination with the risk of post-administration septicemia can occur following the puncture of the elastomeric septum. It is essential to follow directions for activation of DEFINITY carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation.","activeIngredient":3121243},{"uuid":"53964-001","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, POWDER, FOR SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"TEPADINA","proprietaryName":"ADIENNE SA","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TEPADINA (thiotepa) is an alkylating drug indicated: To reduce the risk of graft rejection when used in conjunction with high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) for pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia.

For patients receiving TEPADINA for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with TEPADINA may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with TEPADINA. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of TEPADINA. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with TEPADINA, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity TEPADINA and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with TEPADINA may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to TEPADINA may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case TEPADINA solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of TEPADINA contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with TEPADINA until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose TEPADINA in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with TEPADINA at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of TEPADINA. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of TEPADINA and provide supportive care. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity ( 13.1)]. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of TEPADINA. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, TEPADINA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TEPADINA in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPADINA for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPADINA for at least 1 year after therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TEPADINA is contraindicated in: Patients with severe hypersensitivity to thiotepa [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Adverse Reactions With the Preparative Regimen for Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia The safety of TEPADINA was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 76 pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) using busulfan and cyclophosphamide with TEPADINA (n=25) or without TEPADINA (n=51) [ ]. Adverse reactions were abstracted retrospectively from the medical records. Serious adverse events that occurred in the TEPADINA-treated and control cohort were, respectively: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4% vs 2%), pneumonia (4% vs 0), seizure (4% vs 2%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4% vs 0) and veno-occlusive disease (4% vs 2%). By 90 days after HSCT, grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed in 7 (28%) patients in the TEPADINA cohort and in 13 (26%) patients in the control cohort. By 1-year after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 8 (35%) of 23 evaluable patients in the TEPADINA cohort, and 7 (14%) of 49 evaluable patients in the control cohort. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with TEPADINA from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation are shown in Table 3.

Infuse TEPADINA via a central venous catheter over 3 hours using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 micron in-line filter. Prior to and following each infusion, flush the catheter with approximately 5 ml sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection. TEPADINA is excreted through the skin of patients receiving high-dose therapy. Take precautions to prevent skin toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]. Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. 2.2 Preparation Instructions TEPADINA is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures1. Reconstitution Reconstitute TEPADINA 15 mg with 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. Reconstitute TEPADINA 100 mg with 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2C to 8C (36 to 46F). Dilution in the infusion bag Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Dilute TEPADINA as recommended in Table 2. Table 2: Dilution of TEPADINA in the infusion bag Calculated TEPADINA Dose Dilution Volume (Sodium Chloride 0.9% solution for injection) Less than 250 mg Appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL 250 mg to 500 mg 500 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL Greater than 500 mg 1000 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL After dilution the product is stable for 24 hours when stored at 2C to 8C (36 to 46F) and for 4 hours when stored at 25C (77F). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. Inspect the diluted solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use TEPADINA diluted solutions only if free of visible particulate matter. Filter using a 0.2 micron filter prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency","activeIngredient":3078213},{"uuid":"57894-199","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Abiraterone acetate","proprietaryName":"Janssen Biotech, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Mineralocorticoid excess: Use abiraterone acetate with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The safety of abiraterone acetate in patients with LVEF < 50% or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure in Study 1 or LVEF < 50% or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure in Study 2 was not established. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before treatment. Monitor blood pressure, serum potassium and symptoms of fluid retention at least monthly. (5.1) Adrenocortical insufficiency: Monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations. (5.2) Hepatotoxicity: Can be severe and fatal. Monitor liver function and modify, interrupt, or discontinue abiraterone acetate dosing as recommended. (5.3) 5.1 Hypertension, Hypokalemia and Fluid Retention Due to Mineralocorticoid Excess Abiraterone acetate may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 2% of patients, grade 3 to 4 hypokalemia in 4% of patients, and grade 3 to 4 edema in 1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Co-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting in a reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Use caution when treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, hypokalemia or fluid retention, e.g., those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia. Use abiraterone acetate with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The safety of abiraterone acetate in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (in Study 1) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure (in Study 2) was not established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Monitor patients for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with abiraterone acetate. 5.2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency occurred in the two randomized clinical studies in 0.5% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Use caution and monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone, have prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with abiraterone acetate. If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 ULN) were reported in 4% of patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to liver enzyme increases occurred in 1% of patients taking abiraterone acetate. No deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events. Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function. Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 ULN is unknown.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Abiraterone acetate is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.

Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials enrolled patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or were previously treated with orchiectomy. In both Study 1 and Study 2 abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to control patients. The most common adverse reactions (10%) reported in the two randomized clinical trials that occurred more commonly (>2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, joint swelling or discomfort, edema, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, hypertension, dyspnea, urinary tract infection and contusion. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>20%) reported in the two randomized clinical trials that occurred more commonly (2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, elevated AST, hypophosphatemia, elevated ALT and hypokalemia. Study 1: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy Study 1 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT 2.5 ULN in the absence of liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases were excluded if AST and/or ALT >5 ULN. Table 1 shows adverse reactions on the abiraterone acetate arm in Study 1 that occurred with a 2% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo or were events of special interest.

Grade 34 cardiac failure occurred in 1.6% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 2 deaths. Grade 34 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and one death due to cardiac failure in the placebo group. In Study 1 and 2, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and one patient with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and no deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.5%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 3 (0.3%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 2 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: non-infectious pneumonitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Hepatobiliary Disorders : fulminant hepatitis, including acute hepatic failure and death.","drugClass":"abiraterone","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dose: Abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily. Abiraterone acetate must be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets. (2.1) For patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the abiraterone acetate starting dose to 250 mg once daily. (2.2) For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold abiraterone acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initiated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity. (2.2) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of abiraterone acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily. Abiraterone acetate must be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets. 2.2 Dose Modification Guidelines in Hepatic Impairment and Hepatotoxicity Hepatic Impairment In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily. A once daily dose of 250 mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is predicted to result in an area under the concentration curve (AUC) similar to the AUC seen in patients with normal hepatic function receiving 1,000 mg once daily. However, there are no clinical data at the dose of 250 mg once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and caution is advised. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5 upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3 ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate and do not re-treat patients with abiraterone acetate [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Hepatotoxicity For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with abiraterone acetate (ALT and/or AST greater than 5 ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 ULN), interrupt treatment with abiraterone acetate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 ULN. For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 ULN. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate. The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 ULN is unknown. Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.3 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during abiraterone acetate treatment. Although there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers, because of the potential for an interaction, if a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3109246},{"uuid":"0046-0872","administrationRoute":"VAGINAL","dosageForm":"CREAM","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Premarin","proprietaryName":"Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PREMARIN (conjugated estrogens) Vaginal Cream is a mixture of estrogens indicated for: Treatment of Atrophic Vaginitis and Kraurosis Vulvae (1.1) Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia, a Symptom of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy, due to Menopause (1.2) 1.1 Treatment of Atrophic Vaginitis and Kraurosis Vulvae 1.2 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia, a Symptom of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy, due to Menopause","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (5.5) Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (5.6, 5.7, 5.10, 5.11) Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (5.12, 5.21) 5.1 Risks from Systemic Absorption Systemic absorption occurs with the use of PREMARIN Vaginal Cream. The warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with oral PREMARIN treatment should be taken into account. 5.2 Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg) -alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763), average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.3 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. In a 52-week clinical trial using PREMARIN Vaginal Cream alone (0.5 g inserted twice weekly or daily for 21 days, then off for 7 days), there was no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms, requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.773.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.271.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown. 5.4 Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.832.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.213.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.192.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.6 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 5.7 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 5.8 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 5.9 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5.11 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5.12 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.13 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed. 5.14 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.15 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 5.16 Anaphylactic Reaction and Angioedema Cases of anaphylaxis, which develop within minutes to hours after taking orally-administered PREMARIN and require emergency management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Skin (hives, pruritus, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted. Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients taking orally-administered PREMARIN. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with oral PREMARIN should not receive oral PREMARIN again. 5.17 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.18 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 5.19 Effects on Barrier Contraception PREMARIN Vaginal Cream exposure has been reported to weaken latex condoms. The potential for PREMARIN Vaginal Cream to weaken and contribute to the failure of condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps made of latex or rubber should be considered. 5.20 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. 5.21 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).

A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.15)]. Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens with or without progestins should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (for example, personal history of venous thromboembolism [VTE], obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in all women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg) versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE 0.625 mg compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763), average age 66.7 years, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA(2.5 mg) group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE]) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted3 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE]) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years4 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer Endometrial hyperplasia (a possible precursor of endometrial cancer) has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin WHI substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo.5 Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg). In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg) was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] 6 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent nCI 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen-plus progestin and estrogen-only products has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer over multiple years of use. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association. 5.3 Probable Dementia In the estrogen plus progestin Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, after an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent nCI 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.7)]. In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) or placebo. In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study, after an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent nCI 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.7)]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent nCI 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.7)]. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 5.6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 5.7 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.9 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5.11 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.12 Fluid Retention Estrogens plus progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 5.13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 5.15 Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema, particularly in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 5.17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. 5.18 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay), or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.

Women taking DUAVEE should not take progestins, additional estrogens or additional estrogen agonist/antagonists. 5.2 Cardiovascular Disorders Estrogen agonist/antagonists (including bazedoxifene, a component of DUAVEE) and estrogens individually are known to increase the risk of VTE. An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or VTE (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years). Should a stroke occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately [see Contraindications (4)]. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, silent myocardial infarction, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years). Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE [DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE)] was increased for women receiving daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. If feasible, DUAVEE should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Because immobilization increases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, DUAVEE should be discontinued prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e.g., post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest) and DUAVEE therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, women taking DUAVEE should be advised to move about periodically during travel involving prolonged immobilization. 5.3 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more of treatment. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. DUAVEE contains an estrogen agonist/antagonist. This component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Women taking DUAVEE should not take additional estrogens as this may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Clinical surveillance of all women taking DUAVEE is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical study providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80). The use of estrogen-alone has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. The effect of treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of breast cancer is unknown. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Ovarian Cancer In some epidemiological studies, the use of estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association. The effect of treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of ovarian cancer is unknown. 5.4 Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.832.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, DUAVEE should be permanently discontinued. 5.7 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports in women receiving estrogens, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. 5.8 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with estrogens may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of DUAVEE if pancreatitis occurs. 5.9 Hepatic Impairment and Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice DUAVEE has not been studied in women with impaired liver function or past history of cholestatic jaundice. Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. On average, women with hepatic impairment treated with bazedoxifene alone showed a 4.3-fold increase in overall exposures compared with controls [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised; and in the case of recurrence, DUAVEE should be discontinued. Use of DUAVEE in patients with hepatic impairment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.10 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.11 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Because of this, patients who have conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac dysfunction or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. Use of DUAVEE in patients with renal impairment is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.12 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.14 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 5.15 Premenopausal Women There is no indication for premenopausal use of DUAVEE. The efficacy and safety of DUAVEE in premenopausal women have not been established, and its use is not recommended. 5.16 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. 5.17 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay), or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels. Impaired glucose tolerance.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DUAVEE is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding Known, suspected, or past history of breast cancer Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Active deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or history of these conditions Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction) or history of these conditions Hypersensitivity (for example, anaphylaxis, angioedema) to estrogens, bazedoxifene, or any ingredients Known hepatic impairment or disease Known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders Pregnancy, women who may become pregnant, and nursing mothers.

The safety of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene was evaluated in four Phase 3 clinical trials ranging from 12 weeks to 24 months in duration and enrolling 6,210 postmenopausal women age 40 to 75 years (mean age 55 years). A total of 1,224 patients were treated with DUAVEE and 1,069 patients received placebo. Women enrolled in Studies 1 and 2 received calcium (6001200 mg) and vitamin D (200400 IU) daily, while women in Studies 3 and 4 received no calcium and vitamin D supplementation as part of the protocol. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.0% in the DUAVEE group and 0.2% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 3.5% in the DUAVEE group and 4.8% in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was 7.5% in the DUAVEE group and 10.0% in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were hot flush, abdominal pain upper, and nausea. The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence 5%) more frequently reported in women treated with DUAVEE than placebo are presented in Table 1.

Adverse reactions of venous thromboembolism were reported in 0.0% of patients treated with DUAVEE and 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Due to the low rate of events in both groups, it is not possible to conclude that the risk of venous thromboembolism with DUAVEE is different from that seen with other estrogen therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","drugClass":"conjugated estrogens","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take one tablet orally once daily (2) 2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms Associated with Menopause The recommended dosage is one DUAVEE tablet daily. 2.2 Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis The recommended dosage is one DUAVEE tablet daily. 2.3 General Dosing Information Take DUAVEE once daily, without regard to meals.

An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6 Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms, requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI 0.773.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association. 5.3 Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI 0.832.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI 1.213.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.192.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 5.6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reaction and Angioedema Cases of anaphylaxis, which developed within minutes to hours after taking PREMARIN and require emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted. Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands, and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients taking PREMARIN. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with PREMARIN should not receive PREMARIN again. 5.8 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 5.9 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5.11 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5.12 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.13 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen alone is prescribed. 5.14 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in individuals with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.16 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 5.17 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 5.18 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding dosage for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration and primary ovarian failure. 5.19 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels. Impaired glucose tolerance.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PREMARIN therapy is contraindicated in individuals with any of the following conditions: Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer except in appropriately selected patients being treated for metastatic disease Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema with Premarin Known liver impairment or disease Known protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders.

A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.16)]. Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. PREMARIN may be taken without regard to meals. Daily administration of 0.3, 0.45, 0.625, 0.9, and 1.25 mg (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6) Cyclic administration of 0.3, 0.625, and 1.25 mg (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) 2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. Generally, women should be started at 0.3 mg PREMARIN daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. PREMARIN therapy may be given continuously, with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by 5 days off drug), as is medically appropriate on an individual basis. 2.2 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. Generally, women should be started at 0.3 mg PREMARIN daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. PREMARIN therapy may be given continuously, with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by 5 days off drug), as is medically appropriate on an individual basis. 2.3 Treatment of Hypoestrogenism due to Hypogonadism, Castration, or Primary Ovarian Failure PREMARIN therapy should be initiated and maintained with the lowest effective dose to achieve clinical goals. Female hypogonadism: 0.3 mg or 0.625 mg daily, administered cyclically (e.g., three weeks on and one week off). Doses are adjusted depending on the severity of symptoms and responsiveness of the endometrium [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Female castration or primary ovarian failure: 1.25 mg daily, cyclically. Adjust dosage, upward or downward, according to severity of symptoms and response of the patient. For maintenance, adjust dosage to lowest level that will provide effective control. 2.4 Treatment of Breast Cancer (for Palliation Only) in Appropriately Selected Women and Men with Metastatic Disease Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily, for a period of at least three months. 2.5 Treatment of Advanced Androgen-Dependent Carcinoma of the Prostate (for Palliation Only) 1.25 mg to 2 1.25 mg three times daily. The effectiveness of therapy can be judged by phosphatase determinations as well as by symptomatic improvement of the patient. 2.6 Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis PREMARIN therapy may be given continuously, with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by 5 days off drug), as is medically appropriate on an individual basis. Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. Generally, women should be started at 0.3 mg PREMARIN daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual clinical and bone mineral density responses. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider.","activeIngredient":3082819},{"uuid":"53746-077","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":false,"nameDrug":"Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone","proprietaryName":"Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets and Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets H.S. are indicated in the: Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause in those patients not improved by estrogens alone.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Associated with Estrogens (See WARNINGS regarding induction of neoplasia, adverse effects on the fetus, increased incidence of gallbladder disease, and adverse effects similar to those of oral contraceptives, including thromboembolism). The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogen and/or progestin therapy. Genitourinary System: Changes in vaginal bleeding pattern and abnormal withdrawal bleeding or flow; breakthrough bleeding; spotting; dysmenorrhea, increase in size of uterine leiomyomata; vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis; change in amount of cervical secretion; changes in cervical ectropion; ovarian cancer; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial cancer; cystitis-like syndrome. Breasts: Tenderness; enlargement; pain, nipple discharge, galactorrhea; fibrocystic breast changes; breast cancer. Cardiovascular: Deep and superficial venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; thrombophlebitis; myocardial infarction; stroke; increase in blood pressure. Gastrointestinal: Nausea; vomiting; abdominal cramps; bloating; cholestatic jaundice; increased incidence of gallbladder disease; pancreatitis, enlargement of hepatic hemangiomas. Skin: Chloasma or melasma that may persist when drug is discontinued; erythema multiforme; erythema nodosum; hemorrhagic eruption; loss of scalp hair; hirsutism; pruritus, rash.

Associated with Methyltestosterone Endocrine and Urogenital Female: The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of external genitalia of the female fetus. Skin and Appendages: Hirsutism, male pattern of baldness, and acne. Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances: Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium, and inorganic phosphates. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function test, rarely hepatocellular neoplasms, and peliosis hepatis. (See WARNINGS .) Hematologic: Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X, bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy, and polycythemia. Central Nervous System: Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia. Metabolic: Increased serum cholesterol. Miscellaneous: Inflammation and pain at the site of intramuscular injection or subcutaneous implantation of testosterone containing pellets, stomatitis with buccal preparations, and rarely anaphylactoid reactions.","drugClass":"conjugated estrogens","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary. (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS .) For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Given cyclically for short-term use only: For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause in patients not improved by estrogen alone. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. Administration should be cyclic (e.g., three weeks on and one week off). Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at three- to six month intervals. Usual Dosage Range: 1 tablet of Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets or 1 to 2 tablets of Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets H.S. daily as recommended by the physician. Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.","activeIngredient":3124202},{"uuid":"69189-1201","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Stribild","proprietaryName":"Avera McKennan Hospital","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE STRIBILD is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 35 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of STRIBILD [see Clinical Studies (14)]. STRIBILD is a four-drug combination of elvitegravir, an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor (HIV-1 INSTI), cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor, and emtricitabine and tenofovir DF, both HIV nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (HIV NRTI) and is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 35 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of STRIBILD. (1, 14)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assessment of serum creatinine, serum phosphorous, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein is recommended before initiating STRIBILD therapy and during therapy as clinically appropriate. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensated and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701), 8 (2.3%) subjects in the atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=355), and no subjects in the ATRIPLA (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=352) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group occurred during the first 48 weeks. Four (0.6%) subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD during the first 48 weeks of treatment. Two of the four subjects had renal impairment (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. One (0.3%) subject who received ATV+RTV+TRUVADA developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA after Week 96. STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. It is recommended that serum creatinine, serum phosphorus, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed before initiating STRIBILD and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during STRIBILD therapy; review concomitant medications during STRIBILD therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.5 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects Bone Mineral Density In clinical trials in HIV-1-infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] and consult the tenofovir DF prescribing information. Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir DF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1-infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir DF-treated HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. For more information, please consult the tenofovir DF prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1-infected adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Coadministration of STRIBILD is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.

Clinical Trials in HIV-1-Infected Adult Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week-144 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-nave HIV-1-infected adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily in these two studies. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, or ATV+RTV+TRUVADA due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 6.0%, 7.4%, and 8.5%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm. Table 2 Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events attributed to study drugs.

Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 144 in the STRIBILD group were comparable to that in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group at the lumbar spine (1.43% versus 3.68%, respectively) and at the hip (2.83% versus 3.77%, respectively). In studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 27 subjects (3.9%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 19 subjects (5.4%) in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-nave subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz. Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 52% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 41% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 42% of subjects receiving ATV+RTV+TRUVADA. The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which levels stabilized. Table 4 displays the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels at Week 144 and the percentage of subjects with elevations in serum creatinine (all grades).

Serum Lipids: In the clinical trials of STRIBILD, a similar percentage of subjects receiving STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, and ATV+RTV+TRUVADA were on lipid-lowering agents at baseline (12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively). While receiving study drug through Week 144, an additional 11% of STRIBILD subjects were started on lipid-lowering agents, compared to 13% of ATRIPLA and 12% of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA subjects. Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 5.

In this study, the safety profile of STRIBILD was similar to that in adults. Twenty-two subjects (44%) had treatment-emergent proteinuria (Grades 12). One subject met laboratory criteria for proximal renal tubulopathy, evidenced by sustained proteinuria and normoglycemic glycosuria beginning at Week 32. The subject continued to receive STRIBILD and was ultimately lost to follow-up. Among the 50 pediatric subjects receiving STRIBILD for 48 weeks, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, +0.68% at the lumbar spine and +0.77% for total body less head. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores (height-age adjusted) to Week 48 were 0.09 for lumbar spine and 0.12 for total body less head. At Week 48, 7 STRIBILD subjects had significant (greater than or equal to 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss and 2 had significant total body less head BMD loss. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tenofovir DF.

Assess serum creatinine, serum phosphorous, estimated serum creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein before initiating STRIBILD and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate. (2.1) Recommended dosage: One tablet taken once daily with food. (2.2) Dosage in renal impairment: Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. Discontinue in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute. (2.3) 2.1 Testing Prior to Initiation and During Treatment with STRIBILD Prior to initiation of STRIBILD, patients should be tested for hepatitis B virus infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. It is recommended that serum creatinine, serum phosphorous, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be assessed before initiating STRIBILD and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage STRIBILD is a four-drug fixed dose combination product containing 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 300 mg of tenofovir DF. The recommended dosage of STRIBILD is one tablet taken orally once daily with food in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with a body weight at least 35 kg (at least 77 lbs) and creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 70 mL per minute [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. Because STRIBILD is a fixed-dose combination tablet, STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute during treatment with STRIBILD, as the dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) cannot be achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)]. No data are available to make dose recommendations for pediatric patients with renal impairment. 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment STRIBILD is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3065208},{"uuid":"50090-2279","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Genvoya","proprietaryName":"A-S Medication Solutions","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE GENVOYA is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of GENVOYA [see Clinical Studies (14)]. GENVOYA is a four-drug combination of elvitegravir, an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor, and emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both HIV-1 nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of GENVOYA. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.2) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.3) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Prior to and during therapy, as clinically appropriate, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients, and also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease . (5.4) Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (5.5) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV Patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. GENVOYA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of GENVOYA have not been established in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of GENVOYA. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue GENVOYA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. 5.2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during GENVOYA therapy; review concomitant medications during GENVOYA therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including emtricitabine, a component of GENVOYA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of GENVOYA, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of GENVOYA in treatment-nave subjects and in virologically suppressed subjects switched to GENVOYA with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events or discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with GENVOYA. In a study of virologically suppressed subjects with baseline eGFRs between 30 and 69 mL per minute treated with GENVOYA for a median duration of 144 weeks, GENVOYA was permanently discontinued due to worsening renal function in three of 80 (4%) subjects with a baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL per minute and two of 162 (1%) with a baseline eGFR greater than or equal to 50 mL per minute [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. GENVOYA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute. Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions. Prior to and during treatment, as clinically appropriate, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients, and also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. Discontinue GENVOYA in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Cobicistat, a component of GENVOYA, produces elevations of serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The elevation is typically seen within 2 weeks of starting therapy and is reversible after discontinuation. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.5 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including emtricitabine, a component of GENVOYA, and tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with GENVOYA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Coadministration of GENVOYA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. These drugs and other contraindicated drugs (which may lead to reduced efficacy of GENVOYA and possible resistance) are listed in Table 1 [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 1 Drugs that are Contraindicated with GENVOYA Drug Class Drugs within Class that are Contraindicated with GENVOYA Clinical Comment Alpha 1-Adrenoreceptor Antagonist Alfuzosin Potential for increased alfuzosin concentrations, which can result in hypotension. Anticonvulsants CarbamazepineIndicates that a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted. Phenobarbital Phenytoin Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are potent inducers of CYP450 metabolism and may cause significant decrease in the plasma concentration of elvitegravir, cobicistat, and TAF. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect to GENVOYA. Antimycobacterial Rifampin Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP450 metabolism and may cause significant decrease in the plasma concentration of elvitegravir, cobicistat, and TAF. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect to GENVOYA. Antipsychotics Lurasidone Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions. Pimozide Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Ergot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine Ergotamine Methylergonovine Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues. GI Motility Agent Cisapride Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmias. Herbal Products St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) Coadministration of products containing St. John's wort and GENVOYA may result in reduced plasma concentrations of elvitegravir, cobicistat, and TAF. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Lovastatin Simvastatin Potential for serious reactions such as myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitor SildenafilSee Drug Interactions (7), Table 6 for sildenafil when used for erectile dysfunction. when dosed as REVATIO for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension There is increased potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which include visual disturbances, hypotension, priapism, and syncope). Sedative/hypnotics Triazolam Orally administered midazolamSee Drug Interactions (7), Table 6 for parenterally administered midazolam. Triazolam and orally administered midazolam are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of triazolam or orally administered midazolam with GENVOYA may cause large increases in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. The potential exists for serious and/or life threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Coadministration of GENVOYA is contraindicated with drugs that: Are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious adverse events. (4) Strongly induce CYP3A, which may lead to lower exposure of one or more components and loss of efficacy of GENVOYA and possible resistance.

Clinical Trials in Treatment-Nave Adults The primary safety assessment of GENVOYA was based on Week 144 pooled data from 1,733 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Study 104 and Study 111, in antiretroviral treatment-nave HIV-1 infected adult subjects. A total of 866 subjects received one tablet of GENVOYA once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most common adverse reaction (all Grades) reported in at least 10% of subjects in the GENVOYA group was nausea. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with GENVOYA or STRIBILD due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 1% and 2%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 5% in the GENVOYA group.

Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of GENVOYA in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 96 data from 959 subjects in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 109) in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from a TDF-containing combination regimen to GENVOYA. Overall, the safety profile of GENVOYA in subjects in this study was similar to that of treatment-nave subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

With the exception of a decrease in the mean CD4+ cell count observed in cohort 2 of Study 106, the safety profile in pediatric subjects who received treatment with GENVOYA was similar to that in adults. One 13-year-old female subject developed unexplained uveitis while receiving GENVOYA that resolved and did not require discontinuation of GENVOYA. Bone Mineral Density Effects Cohort 1: Treatment-nave adolescents (12 to less than 18 years; at least 35 kg) Among the subjects in cohort 1 receiving GENVOYA, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, + 4.2% at the lumbar spine and + 1.3% for the total body less head (TBLH). Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were 0.07 for lumbar spine and 0.20 for TBLH at Week 48. One GENVOYA subject had significant (at least 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Cohort 2: Virologically-suppressed children (6 to less than 12 years; at least 25 kg) Among the subjects in cohort 2 receiving GENVOYA, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 24, +2.9% at the lumbar spine and +1.7% for TBLH. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.06 for lumbar spine and -0.18 for TBLH at Week 24. Two GENVOYA subjects had significant (at least 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 24. Change from Baseline in CD4+ cell counts Cohort 2: Virologically-suppressed children (6 to less than 12 years; at least 25 kg) Cohort 2 of Study 106 evaluated pediatric subjects (N=23) who were virologically-suppressed and who switched from their antiretroviral regimen to GENVOYA. Although all subjects had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, there was a decrease from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 24. The mean baseline and mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count and in CD4% from Week 2 to Week 24 are presented in Table 5.

Repackaged By: Cardinal Health Zanesville, OH 43701","adverseReaction":"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have been very common in virtually all series of patients treated with amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias with relatively large doses of drug (400 mg/day and above), occurring in about three-fourths of all patients and causing discontinuation in 7 to 18%. The most serious reactions are pulmonary toxicity, exacerbation of arrhythmia, and rare serious liver injury (see WARNINGS), but other adverse effects constitute important problems. They are often reversible with dose reduction or cessation of amiodarone treatment. Most of the adverse effects appear to become more frequent with continued treatment beyond six months, although rates appear to remain relatively constant beyond one year. The time and dose relationships of adverse effects are under continued study. Neurologic problems are extremely common, occurring in 20 to 40% of patients and including malaise and fatigue, tremor and involuntary movements, poor coordination and gait, and peripheral neuropathy; they are rarely a reason to stop therapy and may respond to dose reductions or discontinuation (see PRECAUTIONS). There have been spontaneous reports of demyelinating polyneuropathy. Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly nausea, vomiting, constipation, and anorexia, occur in about 25% of patients but rarely require discontinuation of drug. These commonly occur during high-dose administration (i.e., loading dose) and usually respond to dose reduction or divided doses. Ophthalmic abnormalities including optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, in some cases progressing to permanent blindness, papilledema, corneal degeneration, photosensitivity, eye discomfort, scotoma, lens opacities, and macular degeneration have been reported (see WARNINGS). Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all adult patients who have been on drug for more than 6 months. Some patients develop eye symptoms of halos, photophobia, and dry eyes. Vision is rarely affected and drug discontinuation is rarely needed. Dermatological adverse reactions occur in about 15% of patients, with photosensitivity being most common (about 10%). Sunscreen and protection from sun exposure may be helpful, and drug discontinuation is not usually necessary. Prolonged exposure to amiodarone occasionally results in a blue-gray pigmentation. This is slowly and occasionally incompletely reversible on discontinuation of drug but is of cosmetic importance only. Cardiovascular adverse reactions, other than exacerbation of the arrhythmias, include the uncommon occurrence of congestive heart failure (3%) and bradycardia. Bradycardia usually responds to dosage reduction but may require a pacemaker for control. CHF rarely requires drug discontinuation. Cardiac conduction abnormalities occur infrequently and are reversible on discontinuation of drug. The following side-effect rates are based on a retrospective study of 241 patients treated for 2 to 1,515 days (mean 441.3 days). The following side effects were each reported in 10 to 33% of patients: Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting. The following side effects were each reported in 4 to 9% of patients: Dermatologic: Solar dermatitis/photosensitivity. Neurologic: Malaise and fatigue, tremor/abnormal involuntary movements, lack of coordination, abnormal gait/ataxia, dizziness, paresthesias. Gastrointestinal: Constipation, anorexia. Ophthalmologic: Visual disturbances. Hepatic: Abnormal liver-function tests. Respiratory: Pulmonary inflammation or fibrosis. The following side effects were each reported in 1 to 3% of patients: Thyroid: Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism. Neurologic: Decreased libido, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances. Cardiovascular: Congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain. Hepatic: Nonspecific hepatic disorders. Other: Flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation, coagulation abnormalities. The following side effects were each reported in less than 1% of patients: Blue skin discoloration, rash, spontaneous ecchymosis, alopecia, hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. In surveys of almost 5,000 patients treated in open U.S. studies and in published reports of treatment with amiodarone, the adverse reactions most frequently requiring discontinuation of amiodarone included pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and elevation of liver enzymes. Other symptoms causing discontinuations less often included visual disturbances, solar dermatitis, blue skin discoloration, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism.

In order to insure that an antiarrhythmic effect will be observed without waiting several months, loading doses are required. A uniform, optimal dosage schedule for administration of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets has not been determined. Because of the food effect on absorption, amiodarone hydrochloride tablets should be administered consistently with regard to meals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Individual patient titration is suggested according to the following guidelines: For Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmias, Such as Ventricular Fibrillation or Hemodynamically Unstable Ventricular Tachycardia Close monitoring of the patients is indicated during the loading phase, particularly until risk of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation has abated. Because of the serious nature of the arrhythmia and the lack of predictable time course of effect, loading should be performed in a hospital setting. Loading doses of 800 to 1,600 mg/day are required for 1 to 3 weeks (occasionally longer) until initial therapeutic response occurs. (Administration of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1,000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.) If side effects become excessive, the dose should be reduced. Elimination of recurrence of ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia usually occurs within 1 to 3 weeks, along with reduction in complex and total ventricular ectopic beats. Since grapefruit juice is known to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of oral amiodarone in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased plasma levels of amiodarone, grapefruit juice should not be taken during treatment with oral amiodarone (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Upon starting amiodarone hydrochloride tablet therapy, an attempt should be made to gradually discontinue prior antiarrhythmic drugs (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). When adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, amiodarone hydrochloride tablet dose should be reduced to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Monitoring Effectiveness). Some patients may require larger maintenance doses, up to 600 mg/day, and some can be controlled on lower doses. Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets may be administered as a single daily dose, or in patients with severe gastrointestinal intolerance, as a b.i.d. dose. In each patient, the chronic maintenance dose should be determined according to antiarrhythmic effect as assessed by symptoms, Holter recordings, and/or programmed electrical stimulation and by patient tolerance. Plasma concentrations may be helpful in evaluating nonresponsiveness or unexpectedly severe toxicity (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The lowest effective dose should be used to prevent the occurrence of side effects. In all instances, the physician must be guided by the severity of the individual patients arrhythmia and response to therapy. When dosage adjustments are necessary, the patient should be closely monitored for an extended period of time because of the long and variable half-life of amiodarone and the difficulty in predicting the time required to attain a new steady-state level of drug.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1.1) treatment of symptomatic heart failure. (1.2) treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and reduce hospitalization for heart failure. (1.3) 1.1 Hypertension EPANED is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children older than one month [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)]. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. EPANED is effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of EPANED and thiazides are approximately additive. 1.2 Heart Failure EPANED is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients, EPANED increases survival and decreases the frequency of hospitalization. 1.3 Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35 percent), EPANED decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactoid Reactions. (5.2) Impaired Renal Function: Assess renal function. (5.5) Hyperkalemia. (5.6) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue EPANED as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Angioedema and Anaphylactoid Reactions Angioedema Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx, including some fatal reactions, have occurred in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including EPANED, at any time during treatment. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. EPANED should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms of angioedema has occurred. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor [see Contraindications (4)]. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients. Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema [see Drug Interactions (7.6, 7.7)]. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has occurred in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. In some cases, the angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactoid Reactions during Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. Anaphylactoid Reactions during Dialysis Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 5.3 Hypotension EPANED can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. In these patients, EPANED should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of EPANED and/or diuretic is increased. Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, EPANED may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be through this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. 5.4 Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function in patients treated with EPANED. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on EPANED. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on EPANED [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving EPANED. Drugs that inhibit the renin angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS EPANED is contraindicated in patients with: a history of angioedema or hypersensitivity related to previous treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

The usual dosage range of enalapril is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single or two divided doses; hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg daily. The side effects (see WARNINGS) of enalapril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects but the addition of enalapril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be given enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/25 mg. Further increases of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide or both depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. In general, patients do not require doses in excess of 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. The daily dosage should not exceed two tablets of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/25 mg. Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Use in Renal Impairment The usual regimens of therapy with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not be adjusted as long as the patients creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (serum creatinine approximately less than or equal to 3 mg/dL or 265 mol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).","activeIngredient":3066238},{"uuid":"42291-153","administrationRoute":"NASAL","dosageForm":"SPRAY, METERED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"AZELASTINE HYDROCHLORIDE","proprietaryName":"AvKARE, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and pediatric patients 5 years and older, and for the treatment of the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and adolescent patients 12 years and older.

Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with DYMISTA. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of DYMISTA until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with DYMISTA. Patients using DYMISTA over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive DYMISTA (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the DYMISTA group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Effects When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of DYMISTA should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of DYMISTA and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of DYMISTA and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving DYMISTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None.

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( 2%) with DYMISTA were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the DYMISTA treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with DYMISTA and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients 6 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients 9 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigators assessment) were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients 6 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients 9 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (2%) with DYMISTA were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the DYMISTA treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis.

PREZISTA is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir (PREZISTA/ritonavir) and with other antiretroviral agents. (1) 1.1 Adult Patients PREZISTA, co-administered with ritonavir (PREZISTA/ritonavir), and with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. This indication is based on analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts from 2 controlled Phase 3 trials of 48 weeks duration in antiretroviral treatment-nave and treatment-experienced patients and 2 controlled Phase 2 trials of 96 weeks duration in clinically advanced, treatment-experienced adult patients. 1.2 Pediatric Patients PREZISTA, co-administered with ritonavir (PREZISTA/ritonavir), and with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients 3 years of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. This indication is based on 24-week analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts from 2 open-label Phase 2 trials in antiretroviral treatment-experienced pediatric patients (one trial in patients 6 to less than 18 years of age and one trial in patients 3 to less than 6 years of age). In treatment-experienced adult and pediatric patients, the following points should be considered when initiating therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir: Treatment history and, when available, genotypic or phenotypic testing should guide the use of PREZISTA/ritonavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. The use of other active agents with PREZISTA/ritonavir is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. (5.2, 6) Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. (5.3, 6) Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.4) Patients may develop new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. (5.6) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) or immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.8) Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. (5.9) PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir up to days 23 to 26 of age. (5.11) 5.1 General PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir and food to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Failure to administer PREZISTA with ritonavir and food may result in a loss of efficacy of darunavir. Please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for additional information on precautionary measures. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N=3063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse events. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZISTA/ritonavir treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Severe Skin Reactions During the clinical development program (n=3063), severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, have been reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZISTA/ritonavir immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in 10.3% of subjects treated with PREZISTA/ritonavir [also see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Rash was mostly mild-to-moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. The discontinuation rate due to rash in subjects using PREZISTA/ritonavir was 0.5%. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing PREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to subjects receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. 5.4 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. In clinical studies with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.5 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for a listing of drugs that are contraindicated for use with PREZISTA/ritonavir due to potentially life-threatening adverse events, significant drug-drug interactions, or loss of therapeutic effect to PREZISTA [see Contraindications (4) ]. Please refer to Table 9 for established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. 5.6 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZISTA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.9 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established. 5.10 Resistance/Cross-Resistance Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among PIs has not been fully explored in PREZISTA/ritonavir treated patients, the effect therapy with PREZISTA will have on the activity of subsequently administered PIs is unknown [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.11 Pediatric Patients Do not administer PREZISTA/ritonavir in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index). These drugs and other contraindicated drugs (which may lead to reduced efficacy of darunavir) are listed in Table 4 [also see Drug Interactions (7.3) , Table 9]. Table 4: Drugs That Are Contraindicated With PREZISTA/ritonavir Drug Class Drugs Within Class That Are Contraindicated With PREZISTA/ritonavir Clinical Comment Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist Alfuzosin Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as hypotension. Ergot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine, Ergonovine, Ergotamine, Methylergonovine Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues. GI Motility Agent Cisapride Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Neuroleptic Pimozide Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Sedative/hypnotics Orally administered Midazolam, Triazolam Triazolam and orally administered midazolam are extensively metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of triazolam or orally administered midazolam with PREZISTA/ritonavir may cause large increases in the concentrations of these benzodiazepines. Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Herbal Products St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) Patients taking PREZISTA/ritonavir should not use products containing St. John's wort because co-administration may result in reduced plasma concentrations of darunavir. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Lovastatin, Simvastatin Potential for serious reactions such as myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. For dosing recommendation regarding atorvastatin and pravastatin, see Table 9: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction. Antimycobacterial Rifampin Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP450 metabolism. PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in combination with rifampin, as this may cause significant decreases in darunavir plasma concentrations. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect to PREZISTA. PDE-5 inhibitor Sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension A safe and effective dose for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has not been established with PREZISTA/ritonavir. There is an increased potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which include visual disturbances, hypotension, prolonged erection, and syncope). Due to the need for co-administration of PREZISTA with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for a description of ritonavir contraindications. Co-administration with alfuzosin, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, cisapride, pimozide, oral midazolam, triazolam, St. John's Wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, rifampin and sildenafil (for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension).

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Due to the need for co-administration of PREZISTA with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for ritonavir-associated adverse reactions. The most common clinical adverse drug reactions to PREZISTA/ritonavir (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, abdominal pain and vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Treatment-Nave Adults Study TMC114-C211 The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211 comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day in 689 antiretroviral treatment-nave HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day arm was 162.5 and 153.5 weeks, respectively. The majority of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported during treatment with PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain and rash. 2.3% of subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs. ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) in antiretroviral treatment-nave HIV-1-infected adult subjects are presented in Table 5 and subsequent text below the table.

The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection. 6.5 Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients PREZISTA/ritonavir has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 2 Phase II trials. TMC114-C212, in which 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 20 kg were included and TMC114-C228, in which 21 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg were included [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults. Study TMC114-C212 ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), excluding laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs, were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%) and fatigue (3%). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%), and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%). Study TMC114-C228 ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea (19%), vomiting (14%) and rash (10%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this study. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of PREZISTA. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Redistribution of body fat has been reported. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and PREZISTA/ritonavir) has been reported. In addition, toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported rarely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].","drugClass":"darunavir","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Treatment-nave adult patients and treatment-experienced adult patients with no darunavir resistance associated substitutions: 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food. (2.1) Treatment-experienced adult patients with at least one darunavir resistance associated substitution: 600 mg (one 600 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food. (2.1) Pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg): dosage of PREZISTA and ritonavir is based on body weight and should not exceed the treatment-experienced adult dose. Do not use once daily dosing in pediatric patients. PREZISTA should be taken with ritonavir twice daily and with food. (2.2) PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. (2.3) 2.1 Adult Patients PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer PREZISTA with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of darunavir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions. Patients who have difficulty swallowing PREZISTA tablets can use the 100 mg/mL PREZISTA oral suspension. Treatment-Nave Adult Patients The recommended oral dose of PREZISTA is 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets or 8 mL of the oral suspension) taken with ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet/capsule or 1.25 mL of a 80 mg/mL ritonavir oral solution) once daily and with food.

However, when genotypic testing is not feasible, PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily dosing is recommended. 2.2 Pediatric Patients (age 3 to less than 18 years) Do not use once daily dosing in pediatric patients. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate dose selection of PREZISTA, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instruction to minimize risk for medication errors, overdose, and underdose. Prescribers should select the appropriate dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for each individual child based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended dose for treatment-experienced adults. Before prescribing PREZISTA, children weighing greater than or equal to 15 kg should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow a tablet, the use of PREZISTA oral suspension should be considered. The recommended dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg is based on body weight (see Tables 1, 2 and 3) and should not exceed the recommended treatment-experienced adult dose (PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily).

No data are available regarding the use of PREZISTA/ritonavir when co-administered to subjects with severe hepatic impairment; therefore, PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].","activeIngredient":3061479},{"uuid":"50090-1723","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"PREZCOBIX","proprietaryName":"A-S Medication Solutions","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PREZCOBIX is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatment-nave and treatment-experienced adults with no darunavir resistance-associated substitutions (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V). PREZCOBIX is a two drug combination of darunavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitor and cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis), liver injury, including some fatalities can occur with PREZCOBIX. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. (5.1, 6) Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, can occur with PREZCOBIX. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. (5.2, 6) Assess creatinine clearance before initiating treatment. (5.3) When PREZCOBIX is used in combination with a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) containing regimen, cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported. (5.4) When used with tenofovir DF: Assess urine glucose and urine protein at baseline and monitor creatinine clearance , urine glucose, and urine protein. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment. (5.4) PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with other antiretroviral drugs that require pharmacokinetic boosting. (5.6) Monitor in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.7) Patients receiving PREZCOBIX may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia (5.8), redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9), and immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.10) Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. (5.11) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity During the darunavir clinical development program (N=3063), where darunavir was co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) was reported in 0.5% of subjects. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse reactions. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have also been reported with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZCOBIX treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZCOBIX should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.2 Severe Skin Reactions During the darunavir clinical development program (n=3063), where darunavir was co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, was reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZCOBIX immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Mild-to-moderate rash was also reported and often occurred within the first four weeks of treatment and resolved with continued dosing. 5.3 Effects on Serum Creatinine Cobicistat decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. This effect should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients initiating PREZCOBIX, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing monitoring with estimated creatinine clearance. Prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX, assess estimated creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Dosage recommendations are not available for drugs that require dosage adjustments in PREZCOBIX-treated patients with renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider alternative medications that do not require dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment. Although cobicistat may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function, patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment When Used With Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported when cobicistat, a component of PREZCOBIX, was used in an antiretroviral regimen that contained tenofovir DF. Co-administration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Document urine glucose and urine protein at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] and perform routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein during treatment when PREZCOBIX is used with tenofovir DF. Measure serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment when used with tenofovir DF. Co-administration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended. See cobicistat full prescribing information for additional information regarding cobicistat. 5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic response Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of PREZCOBIX, which inhibits CYP3A, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PREZCOBIX may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may respectively increase or decrease concentrations of PREZCOBIX. Increased concentrations may lead to: clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from higher exposures of concomitant medications. clinically significant adverse reactions from higher exposures of PREZCOBIX. Decreased antiretroviral concentrations may lead to: loss of therapeutic effect of PREZCOBIX and possible development of resistance. See Table 2 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREZCOBIX therapy; review concomitant medications during PREZCOBIX therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. When used with concomitant medications, PREZCOBIX may result in different drug interactions than those observed or expected with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of drug interactions with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir to certain PREZCOBIX interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Antiretrovirals Not Recommended PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with other antiretroviral drugs that require pharmacokinetic boosting (i.e., another protease inhibitor or elvitegravir) because dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and co-administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of the antiretroviral agents, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with products containing the individual components of PREZCOBIX (darunavir and cobicistat) or with ritonavir. For additional recommendations on use of PREZCOBIX with other antiretroviral agents, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.7 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Monitor patients with a known sulfonamide allergy after initiating PREZCOBIX. In clinical studies with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.8 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients receiving HIV protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between HIV PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZCOBIX. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.11 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with HIV PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with HIV PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PREZCOBIX is contraindicated with the following drugs (see Table 1) due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening events or loss of therapeutic effect [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Table 2].

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Due to the need for co-administration of PREZISTA with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for ritonavir-associated adverse reactions. The most common clinical adverse drug reactions to PREZISTA/ritonavir (incidence 5%) of at least moderate intensity ( Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, abdominal pain and vomiting.

reconstitution syndrome, low density lipoprotein increased, nausea, pancreatic enzyme increased, rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and vomiting. 6.4 Additional ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir identified in adult subjects in other clinical trials The additional ADR of interest identified from other clinical trials was osteonecrosis. 6.5 Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus In subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir, the incidence of adverse events and clinical chemistry abnormalities was not higher than in subjects receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir who were not co-infected, except for increased hepatic enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection. 6.6 Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients PREZISTA/ritonavir has been studied in 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to < 18 years of age and weighing at least 44 lbs (20 kg) in combination with other antiretroviral agents [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults. ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, 3%), excluding laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs, were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%) and fatigue (3%). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%), and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%). 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of PREZISTA. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Redistribution of body fat has been reported. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and PREZISTA/ritonavir) and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].","drugClass":"darunavir","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Treatment-nave adult patients: 800 mg (two 400 mg tablets) taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food.

Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate dose selection of PREZISTA, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instruction to minimize risk for medication errors, overdose, and underdose. Prescribers should select the appropriate dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for each individual child based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended dose for treatment-experienced adults. Before prescribing PREZISTA, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow a tablet, the use of PREZISTA tablets may not be appropriate. The recommended dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for pediatric patients (6 to < 18 years of age and weighing at least 44 lbs (20 kg)) is based on body weight (see Table 1) and should not exceed the recommended treatment-experienced adult dose (PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg b.i.d.).

Adverse Reactions Occurring in Patients with Idiopathic or Heritable PAH and with PAH Associated with Scleroderma Spectrum of Diseases (PAH/SSD) Occurring 10% More Frequently on Epoprostenol than Conventional Therapy Adverse Reaction Idiopathic or Heritable PAH PAH/SSD Epoprostenol (n = 52) Conventional Therapy (n = 54) Epoprostenol (n = 56) Conventional Therapy (n = 55) Body as a whole Jaw pain 54% 0% 75% 0% Nonspecific musculoskeletal pain 35% 15% 84% 65% Headache 83% 33% 46% 5% Chills/fever/sepsis/flu-like symptoms 25% 11% 13% 11% Cardiovascular system Flushing 42% 2% 23% 0% Hypotension 27% 31% 13% 0% Tachycardia 35% 24% 43% 42% Digestive system Anorexia 25% 30% 66% 47% Nausea/Vomiting 67% 48% 41% 16% Diarrhea 37% 6% 50% 5% Skin and Appendages Skin ulcer - - 39% 24% Eczema/rash/urticaria 10% 13% 25% 4% Musculoskeletal system Myalgia 44% 31% - - Nervous system Anxiety/hyperkinesias/nervousness /tremor 21% 9% 7% 5% Hyperesthesia/hypesthesia/paresthesia 12% 2% 5% 0% Dizziness 83% 70% 59% 76% Adverse Events Attributable to the Drug Delivery System Chronic infusions of epoprostenol are delivered using a small, portable infusion pump through an indwelling central venous catheter. During controlled PAH trials of up to 12 weeks duration, the local infection rate was about 18%, and the rate for pain was about 11%. During long-term follow-up, sepsis was reported at a rate of 0.3 infections/patient per year in patients treated with epoprostenol. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postapproval use of epoprostenol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic Anemia, hypersplenism, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperthyroidism. Gastrointestinal Hepatic failure. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Pulmonary embolism.","drugClass":"epoprostenol","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiate intravenous infusion through a central venous catheter at 2 ng/kg/min. (2.2, 2.3) Change dose in 1-to 2-ng/kg/min increments at intervals of at least 15 minutes based on clinical response. (2.2) Avoid sudden large dose reductions. (2.2, 5.2) 2.1 Reconstitution Each vial is for single dose only; discard any unused diluent or unused reconstituted solution. Select a concentration for the solution of epoprostenol sodium for injection that is compatible with the infusion pump being used with respect to minimum and maximum flow rates, reservoir capacity, and the infusion pump criteria listed below [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Using aseptic technique, reconstitute epoprostenol sodium for injection only with STERILE DILUENT for epoprostenol sodium for injection. Table 1 gives directions for preparing several different concentrations of epoprostenol sodium for injection. See Table 2 for storage and administration time limits for the reconstituted epoprostenol sodium for injection. Table 1. Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions for Epoprostenol Sodium for Injection Using STERILE DILUENT for Epoprostenol Sodium for Injection. To make 100 mL of solution with final concentration of: Directions: 3,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of one 0.5-mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw 3 mL and add to sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 5,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of one 0.5-mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 10,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of two 0.5-mg vials each with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 15,000 ng/mLHigher concentrations may be prepared for patients who receive epoprostenol sodium for injection long-term. Dissolve contents of one 1.5-mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. When used with a cold pack, reconstituted solutions: Table 2. Storage and Administration Limits for Reconstituted Epoprostenol Sodium for Injection When Using STERILE DILUENT for Epoprostenol Sodium for Injection Stability When used at room temperature, (15C to 25C; 59F to 77F) reconstituted solutions: are stable for up to 8 hours following reconstitution or removal from refrigerated storage may be stored for up to 40 hours refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) before use. are stable for up to 24 hours use may be stored refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) before use as long as the total time of refrigerated storage and infusion does not exceed 48 hours Change cold packs every 12 hours. Reconstituted solutions can be used immediately. Refrigerate at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) if not used immediately. Protect from light. Do not freeze reconstituted solutions. 2.2 Dosage Initiate intravenous infusions of epoprostenol sodium for injection at 2 ng/kg/min. Alter the infusion by 1- to 2-ng/kg/min increments at intervals sufficient to allow assessment of clinical response. These intervals should be at least 15 minutes. During dose initiation, asymptomatic increases in pulmonary artery pressure coincident with increases in cardiac output may occur. In such cases, consider dose reduction, but such an increase does not imply that chronic treatment is contraindicated. Base changes in the chronic infusion rate on persistence, recurrence, or worsening of the patient's symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and the occurrence of adverse vasodilatory reactions. In general, expect progressive increases in dose. If dose-related adverse reactions occur, make dose decreases gradually in 2-ng/kg/min decrements every 15 minutes or longer until the dose-limiting effects resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of epoprostenol sodium for injection or sudden large reductions in infusion rates [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]. Following establishment of a new chronic infusion rate, measure standing and supine blood pressure for several hours. Taper doses of epoprostenol sodium for injection after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients receiving lung transplants. 2.3 Administration Initiate epoprostenol in a setting with adequate personnel and equipment for physiologic monitoring and emergency care. Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If either particulate matter or discoloration is noted, do not use. Administer continuous chronic infusion of epoprostenol sodium for injection through a central venous catheter. Temporary peripheral intravenous infusion may be used until central access is established. Do not administer bolus injections of epoprostenol sodium for injection. The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer epoprostenol sodium for injection should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) be able to adjust infusion rates in 2-ng/kg/min increments, (3) have occlusion, end-of-infusion, and low-battery alarms, (4) be accurate to 6% of the programmed rate, and (5) be positive-pressure-driven (continuous or pulsatile) with intervals between pulses not exceeding 3 minutes at infusion rates used to deliver epoprostenol sodium for injection. The reservoir should be made of polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, or glass. Use a 60-inch microbore non-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extension set with proximal antisyphon valve, low priming volume (0.9 mL), and in-line 0.22-micron filter. To avoid interruptions in drug delivery, the patient should have access to a backup infusion pump and intravenous infusion sets. Do not administer or dilute reconstituted solutions of epoprostenol sodium for injection with other parenteral solutions or medications. Consider a multi-lumen catheter if other intravenous therapies are routinely administered. Select a concentration for the solution of epoprostenol sodium for injection that is compatible with the infusion pump being used with respect to minimum and maximum flow rates, reservoir capacity, and the infusion pump criteria listed above. When administered chronically, prepare epoprostenol sodium for injection in a drug delivery reservoir appropriate for the infusion pump with a total reservoir volume of at least 100 mL, using 2 vials of STERILE DILUENT for epoprostenol sodium for injection. Generally, 3,000 ng/mL and 10,000 ng/mL are satisfactory concentrations to deliver between 2 to 16 ng/kg/min in adults. Higher infusion rates, and therefore, more concentrated solutions may be necessary with long-term administration of epoprostenol sodium for injection. Infusion rates may be calculated using the following formula: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (ng/kg/min) Weight (kg) 60 min/h] Final Concentration (ng/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a 60-kg person at the recommended initial dose of 2 ng/kg/min using a 3,000-ng/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [2 (ng/kg/min) 60 (kg) 60 (min/h)] = 2.4 (mL/h) 3,000 (ng/mL) Example 2: for a 70-kg person at a dose of 16 ng/kg/min using a 15,000-ng/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [16 (ng/kg/min) 70 (kg) 60 (min/h)] = 4.48 (mL/h) 15,000 (ng/mL)","activeIngredient":3089108},{"uuid":"76112-402","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, POWDER, LYOPHILIZED, FOR SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":false,"nameDrug":"Veletri","proprietaryName":"Jubilant HollisterStier General Partnership","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":null,"warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"epoprostenol","maximumDoseSchedule":null,"activeIngredient":3108707},{"uuid":"68094-757","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Lithium","proprietaryName":"Precision Dose Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lithium is indicated in the treatment of manic episodes of Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar Disorder, Manic (DSM-III) is equivalent to Manic Depressive illness, Manic, in the older DSM-II terminology. Lithium is also indicated as a maintenance treatment for individuals with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Maintenance therapy reduces the frequency of manic episodes and diminishes the intensity of those episodes which may occur. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, elation, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possibly hostility. When given to a patient experiencing a manic episode, lithium may produce a normalization of symptomatology within 1 to 3 weeks.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Lithium should generally not be given to patients with significant renal or cardiovascular disease, severe debilitation or dehydration, or sodium depletion, and to patients receiving diuretics, since the risk of lithium toxicity is very high in such patients.

Serum lithium levels greater than 1.5 mEq/l carry a greater risk than lower levels. However, patients sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels below 1.5 mEq/l. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium toxicity, and can occur at lithium levels below 2.0 mEq/l. At higher levels, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3.0 mEq/l may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq/l during the acute treatment phase. Fine hand tremor, polyuria and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These side effects are an inconvenience rather than a disabling condition, and usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of dosage is indicated. The following adverse reactions have been reported and do not appear to be directly related to serum lithium levels. Neuromuscular: Tremor, muscle hyperirritability (fasciculations, twitching, clonic movements of whole limbs), ataxia, choreo-athetotic movements, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. Central Nervous System: Blackout spells, epileptiform seizures, slurred speech, dizziness, vertigo, incontinence of urine or feces, somnolence, psychomotor retardation, restlessness, confusion, stupor, coma, acute dystonia, downbeat nystagmus. Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmia, hypotension, peripheral circulatory collapse, sinus node dysfunction with severe bradycardia (which may result in syncope), unmasking of Brugada Syndrome (See WARNINGS: Unmasking of Brugada Syndrome and PRECAUTIONS: Information for the Patients ). Neurological: Cases of pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure and papilledema) have been reported with lithium use. If undetected, this condition may result in enlargement of the blind spot, constriction of visual fields and eventual blindness due to optic atrophy. Lithium should be discontinued, if clinically possible, if this syndrome occurs. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Genitourinary: Albuminuria, oliguria, polyuria, glycosuria. Dermatologic: Drying and thinning of hair, anesthesia of skin, chronic folliculitis, xerosis cutis, alopecia and exacerbation of psoriasis. Autonomic Nervous System: Blurred vision, dry mouth. Thyroid Abnormalities: Euthyroid goiter and/or hypothyroidism (including myxedema) accompanied by lower T3 and T4. Iodine 131 uptake may be elevated. (See PRECAUTIONS ). Paradoxically, rare cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. EEG Changes: Diffuse slowing, widening of frequency spectrum, potentiation and disorganization of background rhythm. EKG Changes: Reversible flattening, isoelectricity or inversion of T-waves. Miscellaneous: Fatigue, lethargy, transient scotomata, dehydration, weight loss, tendency to sleep. Miscellaneous Reactions Unrelated to Dosage are: Transient electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic changes, leucocytosis, headache, diffuse non-toxic goiter with or without hypothyroidism, transient hyperglycemia, generalized pruritis with or without rash, cutaneous ulcers, albuminuria, worsening of organic brain syndromes, excessive weight gain, edematous swelling of ankles or wrists, and thirst or polyuria, sometimes resembling diabetes insipidus, and metallic taste. A single report has been received of the development of painful discoloration of fingers and toes and coldness of the extremities within one day of the starting of treatment of lithium. The mechanism through which these symptoms (resembling Raynaud's Syndrome) developed is not known. Recovery followed discontinuance.","drugClass":"lithium","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Acute Mania Optimal patient response to Lithium Carbonate usually can be established and maintained with 600 mg t.i.d. Optimal patient response to Lithium Oral Solution usually can be established and maintained with 10 mL (2 full teaspoons) (16 mEq of lithium) t.i.d. Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium level ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/l. Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized. Long-Term Control The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/l. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 300 mg of Lithium Carbonate t.i.d. or q.i.d., or 5 mL (1 full teaspoon) (8 mEq of Lithium) of Lithium Oral Solution t.i.d. or q.i.d. will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/l. Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by other patients. N.B. Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8-12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.","activeIngredient":3068905},{"uuid":"59572-402","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"CAPSULE","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Revlimid","proprietaryName":"Celgene Corporation","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE REVLIMID is a thalidomide analogue indicated for the treatment of patients with: Multiple myeloma (MM), in combination with dexamethasone (1.1).

Early mortality in MCL: Higher rate of early deaths have occurred in patients with MCL (5.14). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity REVLIMID is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life-threatening human birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. An embryo-fetal development study in monkeys indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy, similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy. REVLIMID is only available through the REVLIMID REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning REVLIMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with REVLIMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of REVLIMID therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing REVLIMID therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID. 5.2 REVLIMID REMS Program Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], REVLIMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the REVLIMID REMS program. Required components of the REVLIMID REMS program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician agreement form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3 Hematologic Toxicity REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medication that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients taking REVLIMID should have their complete blood counts assessed periodically as described below [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]. Patients taking REVLIMID in combination with dexamethasone or as REVLIMID maintenance therapy for MM should have their complete blood counts (CBC) assessed every 7 days (weekly) for the first 2 cycles, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 3, and every 28 days (4 weeks) thereafter. A dose interruption and/or dose reduction may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the MM maintenance therapy trials, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in up to 59% of REVLIMID-treated patients and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in up to 38% of REVLIMID-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients taking REVLIMID for MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the MDS study. In the 48% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 42 days (range, 14-411 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 17 days (range, 2-170 days). In the 54% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to onset was 28 days (range, 8-290 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 22 days (range, 5-224 days) [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Patients taking REVLIMID for MCL should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. In the MCL trial, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 43% of the patients. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 28% of the patients. 5.4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events (VTE [DVT and PE]) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE, myocardial infarction and stroke) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID. A significantly increased risk of DVT (7.4%) and of PE (3.7%) occurred in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated in the placebo and dexamethasone group (3.1% and 0.9%) in clinical trials with varying use of anticoagulant therapies. In the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, DVT was reported as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, and 1.7%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively) [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Myocardial infarction (1.7%) and stroke (CVA) (2.3%) are increased in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone (0.6%, and 0.9%) in clinical trials. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as a serious adverse reaction (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of CVA was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). In controlled clinical trials that did not use concomitant thromboprophylaxis, 21.5% overall thrombotic events (Standardized MedDRA Query Embolic and Thrombotic events) occurred in patients with refractory and relapsed MM who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone compared to 8.3% thrombosis in patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone. The median time to first thrombosis event was 2.8 months. In the NDMM study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, the overall frequency of thrombotic events was 17.4% in patients in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms, and was 11.6% in the MPT Arm. The median time to first thrombosis event was 4.3 months in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended. The regimen of thromboprophylaxis should be based on an assessment of the patients underlying risks. Instruct patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision in patients receiving REVLIMID [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with CLL In a prospective randomized (1:1) clinical trial in the first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, single agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single agent chlorambucil. In an interim analysis, there were 34 deaths among 210 patients on the REVLIMID treatment arm compared to 18 deaths among 211 patients in the chlorambucil treatment arm, and hazard ratio for overall survival was 1.92 [95% CI: 1.08 3.41], consistent with a 92% increase in the risk of death. The trial was halted for safety in July 2013. Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID treatment arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.6 Second Primary Malignancies In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor second primary malignancies (SPM) notably AML and MDS have been observed. An increase in hematologic SPM including AML and MDS occurred in 5.3% of patients with NDMM receiving REVLIMID in combination with oral melphalan compared with 1.3% of patients receiving melphalan without REVLIMID. The frequency of AML and MDS cases in patients with NDMM treated with REVLIMID in combination with dexamethasone without melphalan was 0.4%. In patients receiving REVLIMID maintenance therapy following high dose intravenous melphalan and auto-HSCT, hematologic SPM occurred in 7.5% of patients compared to 3.3% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 14.9%, compared to 8.8% in patients receiving placebo with a median follow-up of 91.5 months. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.9% of patients receiving REVLIMID maintenance, compared to 2.6% in the placebo arm. In patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with REVLIMID/dexamethasone, the incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 2.3% versus 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving REVLIMID/dexamethasone, compared to 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm. Patients who received REVLIMID-containing therapy until disease progression did not show a higher incidence of invasive SPM than patients treated in the fixed duration REVLIMID-containing arms. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with REVLIMID. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. In clinical trials, 15% of patients experienced hepatotoxicity (with hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed characteristics); 2% of patients with MM and 1% of patients with myelodysplasia had serious hepatotoxicity events. The mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered. 5.9 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Including Hypersensitivity Reactions Angioedema and severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. REVLIMID must be discontinued for angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions. 5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. The patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 5.11 Tumor Flare Reaction Tumor flare reaction has occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for CLL and lymphoma, and is characterized by tender lymph node swelling, low grade fever, pain and rash. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials. Monitoring and evaluation for tumor flare reaction (TFR) is recommended in patients with MCL. Tumor flare reaction may mimic progression of disease (PD). In the MCL trial, 13/134 (10%) of subjects experienced TFR; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. All of the events occurred in cycle 1 and one patient developed TFR again in cycle 11. Lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physicians discretion. Patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR may also be treated with corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with lenalidomide until TFR resolves to Grade 1. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR. 5.12 Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (> 4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. In patients who are auto-HSCT candidates, referral to a transplant center should occur early in treatment to optimize the timing of the stem cell collection. In patients who received more than 4 cycles of a REVLIMID-containing treatment or for whom inadequate numbers of CD 34+ cells have been collected with G-CSF alone, G-CSF with cyclophosphamide or the combination of G-CSF with a CXCR4 inhibitor may be considered. 5.13 Thyroid Disorders Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Measure thyroid function before start of REVLIMID treatment and during therapy. 5.14 Early Mortality in Patients with MCL In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks), 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. On exploratory multivariate analysis, risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline ( 10 x 109/L).","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy (Boxed Warning, 4.1, 5.1, 8.1). Demonstrated severe hypersensitivity to lenalidomide (4.2, 5.9). 4.1 Pregnancy REVLIMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Limb abnormalities were seen in the offspring of monkeys that were dosed with lenalidomide during organogenesis. This effect was seen at all doses tested. Due to the results of this developmental monkey study, and lenalidomides structural similarities to thalidomide, a known human teratogen, lenalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant [see Boxed Warning]. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in Special Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 4.2 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions REVLIMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied White and blue-green opaque hard capsules imprinted REV on one half and 2.5 mg on the other half in black ink: 2.5 mg bottles of 28 (NDC 59572-402-28) 2.5 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-402-00) White opaque capsules imprinted REV on one half and 5 mg on the other half in black ink: 5 mg bottles of 28 (NDC 59572-405-28) 5 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-405-00) Blue/green and pale yellow opaque capsules imprinted REV on one half and 10 mg on the other half in black ink: 10 mg bottles of 28 (NDC 59572-410-28) 10 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-410-00) Powder blue and white opaque capsules imprinted REV on one half and 15 mg on the other half in black ink: 15 mg bottles of 21 (NDC 59572-415-21) 15 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-415-00) Powder blue and blue-green opaque hard capsules imprinted REV on one half and 20 mg on the other half in black ink. 20 mg bottles of 21 (NDC 59572-420-21) 20 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-420-00) White opaque capsules imprinted REV on one half and 25 mg on the other half in black ink: 25 mg bottles of 21 (NDC 59572-425-21) 25 mg bottles of 100 (NDC 59572-425-00) 16.2 Storage Store at 20C - 25C (68F - 77F); excursions permitted to 15C - 30C (59F - 86F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. 16.3 Handling and Disposal Care should be exercised in the handling of REVLIMID.

Newly Diagnosed MM REVLIMID Combination Therapy: Data were evaluated from 1613 patients in a large phase 3 study who received at least one dose of REVLIMID with low dose dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease [Arm Rd Continuous; N=532] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72 weeks, Arm Rd18; N=540] or who received melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (Arm MPT; N=541) for a maximum of twelve 42-day cycles (72 weeks). The median treatment duration in the Rd Continuous arm was 80.2 weeks (range 0.7 to 246.7) or 18.4 months (range 0.16 to 56.7). In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were comparable in Arm Rd Continuous and Arm Rd18, and included diarrhea, anemia, constipation, peripheral edema, neutropenia, fatigue, back pain, nausea, asthenia, and insomnia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, asthenia, fatigue, back pain, hypokalemia, rash, cataract, lymphopenia, dyspnea, DVT, hyperglycemia, and leukopenia. The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous (75%) compared to Arm MPT (56%). There were more grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18. In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption of REVLIMID were infection events (28.8%); overall, the median time to the first dose interruption of REVLIMID was 7 weeks. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of REVLIMID in the Rd Continuous arm were hematologic events (10.7%); overall, the median time to the first dose reduction of REVLIMID was 16 weeks. In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of REVLIMID were infection events (3.4%). In both Rd arms, the frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment, except for cataracts. The frequency of onset of cataracts increased over time with 0.7% during the first 6 months and up to 9.6% by the 2nd year of treatment with Rd Continuous.

Maintenance Therapy Following Auto-HSCT: Data were evaluated from 1018 patients in two randomized trials who received at least one dose of REVLIMID 10 mg daily as maintenance therapy after auto-HSCT until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, The mean treatment duration for REVLIMID treatment was 30.3 months for Maintenance Study 1 and 24.0 months for Maintenance Study 2 (overall range across both studies from 0.1 to 108 months). As of the cut-off date of 1 Mar 2015, 48 patients (21%) in the Maintenance Study 1 REVLIMID arm were still on treatment and none of the patients in the Maintenance Study 2 REVLIMID arm were still on treatment at the same cut-off date The adverse reactions listed from Maintenance Study 1 included events reported post-transplant (completion of high-dose melphalan /auto-HSCT), and the maintenance treatment period. In Maintenance Study 2, the adverse reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only. In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (more than 20% in the REVLIMID arm) across both studies were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, cough, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, asthenia, muscle spasm and pyrexia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions (more than 20% in the REVLIMID arm) included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The serious adverse reactions lung infection and neutropenia (more than 4.5%) occurred in the REVLIMID arm. For REVLIMID, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were hematologic events (29.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reduction of REVLIMID were hematologic events (17.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of REVLIMID were thrombocytopenia (2.7%) in Maintenance Study 1 and neutropenia (2.4%) in Maintenance Study 2. The frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions reported for the REVLIMID and placebo maintenance treatment arms.

patients) or placebo/dexamethasone (350 patients). In the REVLIMID/dexamethasone treatment group, 269 patients (76%) had at least one dose interruption with or without a dose reduction of REVLIMID compared to 199 patients (57%) in the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Of these patients who had one dose interruption with or without a dose reduction, 50% in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone treatment group had at least one additional dose interruption with or without a dose reduction compared to 21% in the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Most adverse reactions and Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were more frequent in patients who received the combination of REVLIMID/dexamethasone compared to placebo/dexamethasone. Tables 6, 7, and 8 summarize the adverse reactions reported for REVLIMID/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported as a serious (7.4%) or severe (8.2%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 3.1 % and 3.4% in the placebo/dexamethasone group, respectively in the 2 studies in patients with at least 1 prior therapy with discontinuations due to DVT adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, DVT was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 10.3%, 7.2%, 4.1%), as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, 1.7%), and as a Grade 3/4 adverse reaction (5.6%, 3.7%, 2.8%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. Discontinuations and dose reductions due to DVT adverse reactions were reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms (both <1%). Interruption of REVLIMID treatment due to DVT adverse reactions was reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous (2.3%) and Rd18 (1.5%) arms. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported as a serious adverse drug reaction (3.7%) or Grade 3/4 (4.0%) at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% (serious or grade 3/4) in the placebo/dexamethasone group in the 2 studies in patients with, at least 1 prior therapy, with discontinuations due to PE adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, the frequency of adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms for adverse reactions (all grades: 3.9%, 3.3%, and 4.3%, respectively), serious adverse reactions (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively), and grade 3/4 adverse reactions (3.8%, 3.0%, and 3.7%, respectively). Myocardial infarction was reported as a serious (1.7%) or severe (1.7%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.6 % and 0.6% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to MI (including acute) adverse reactions was 0.8% in REVLIMID/dexamethasone group and none in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 2.4%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), as a serious adverse reaction, (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), or as a severe adverse reaction (1.9%, 0.6%, and 0.9%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. Stroke (CVA) was reported as a serious (2.3%) or severe (2.0%) adverse drug reaction in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% and 0.9% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to stroke (CVA) was 1.4% in REVLIMID/ dexamethasone group and 0.3% in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, CVA was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 0.8%, 0.6%, and 0.6%), as a serious adverse reaction (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%), or as a severe adverse reaction (0.6%, 0.6%, 0.2%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT arms respectively. Other Adverse Reactions: After At Least One Prior Therapy for MM In these 2 studies, the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) not described above that occurred at 1% rate and of at least twice of the placebo percentage rate were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia Cardiac disorders: bradycardia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris Endocrine disorders: hirsutism Eye disorders: blindness, ocular hypertension Gastrointestinal disorders: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossodynia General disorders and administration site conditions: malaise Investigations: liver function tests abnormal, alanine aminotransferase increased Nervous system disorders: cerebral ischemia Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, hallucination, loss of libido Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough, hoarseness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: exanthem, skin hyperpigmentation Myelodysplastic Syndromes: A total of 148 patients received at least 1 dose of 10 mg REVLIMID in the del 5q MDS clinical study. At least one adverse event was reported in all of the 148 patients who were treated with the 10 mg starting dose of REVLIMID. The most frequently reported adverse events were related to blood and lymphatic system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and general disorders and administrative site conditions. Thrombocytopenia (61.5%; 91/148) and neutropenia (58.8%; 87/148) were the most frequently reported adverse events. The next most common adverse events observed were diarrhea (48.6%; 72/148), pruritus (41.9%; 62/148), rash (35.8%; 53/148) and fatigue (31.1%; 46/148). Table 9 summarizes the adverse events that were reported in 5% of the REVLIMID treated patients in the del 5q MDS clinical study. Table 10 summarizes the most frequently observed Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse reactions regardless of relationship to treatment with REVLIMID. In the single-arm studies conducted, it is often not possible to distinguish adverse events that are drug-related and those that reflect the patients underlying disease.

( Boxed Warning, 5.1) Fatal or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, may be fatal or life threatening. Early signs may include rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. These reactions may be associated with other organ involvement, such as hepatitis, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, or acute multiorgan failure. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if alternate etiology for this reaction is not found. ( 5.2) Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia): May occur, either with or without an associated hypersensitivity syndrome. Monitor for signs of anemia, unexpected infection, or bleeding. ( 5.3) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. ( 5.4) Aseptic meningitis: Monitor for signs of meningitis. ( 5.5) Medication errors due to product name confusion: Strongly advise patients to visually inspect tablets to verify the received drug is correct. ( 5.6, 16, 17) 5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning] Pediatric Population The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) is Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in US and foreign postmarketing experience. The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) is approximately 0.3% to 0.8%. One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy.Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in US and foreign postmarketing experience. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. Adult Population Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate.

No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity . Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] . There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized.

Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. 5.2 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use. Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately. 5.3 Blood Dyscrasias There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] . These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.4 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 7 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 7. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1 , 000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1 , 000 Patients Relative Risk : Incidence of Events in Drug Patients / Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference : Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1 , 000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] . 5.6 Potential Medication Errors Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the names lamotrigine or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine tablets can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription. 5.7 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)] . During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.8 Withdrawal Seizures As with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)] . 5.9 Status Epilepticus Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made. 5.10 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect. 5.11 Addition of Lamotrigine to a Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions ( 7)] . 5.12 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in 1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigine's binding to melanin is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2)] . Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.13 Laboratory Tests False-Positive Drug Test Results Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.

Epilepsy Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Clinical Trials: Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with lamotrigine during adjunctive therapy in adults and not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were: dizziness, ataxia, somnolence, headache, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting were dose related. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision occurred more commonly in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Clinical data suggest a higher incidence of rash, including serious rash, in patients receiving concomitant valproate than in patients not receiving valproate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] . Approximately 11% of the 3,378 adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (3.0%), dizziness (2.8%), and headache (2.5%). In a dose-response trial in adults, the rate of discontinuation of lamotrigine for dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting was dose related. Monotherapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine during the monotherapy phase of the controlled trial in adults not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were vomiting, coordination abnormality, dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, rhinitis, anxiety, insomnia, infection, pain, weight decrease, chest pain, and dysmenorrhea. The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions associated with the use of lamotrigine during the conversion to monotherapy (add-on) period, not seen at an equivalent frequency among low-dose valproate-treated patients, were dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, coordination abnormality, vomiting, rash, somnolence, diplopia, ataxia, accidental injury, tremor, blurred vision, insomnia, nystagmus, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, pruritus, and sinusitis. Approximately 10% of the 420 adult patients who received lamotrigine as monotherapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.5%), headache (3.1%), and asthenia (2.4%). Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric Patients with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years and not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were infection, vomiting, rash, fever, somnolence, accidental injury, dizziness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, ataxia, tremor, asthenia, bronchitis, flu syndrome, and diplopia. In 339 patients aged 2 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures or generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 4.2% of patients on lamotrigine and 2.9% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reaction that led to discontinuation of lamotrigine was rash. Approximately 11.5% of the 1,081 pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.4%), reaction aggravated (1.7%), and ataxia (0.6%). Controlled Adjunctive Clinical Trials in Adults with Epilepsy: Table 8 lists adverse reactions that occurred in adult patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, either lamotrigine or placebo was added to the patient's current AED therapy. Table 8.

Because the largest non-Caucasian racial subgroup was only 6% of patients exposed to lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reaction reports by race. Generally, females receiving either lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or placebo were more likely to report adverse reactions than males. The only adverse reaction for which the reports on lamotrigine were greater than 10% more frequent in females than males (without a corresponding difference by gender on placebo) was dizziness (difference = 16.5%). There was little difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of lamotrigine for individual adverse reactions.

Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients and were numerically more frequent during the dose-escalation phase of lamotrigine in these trials (when patients may have been receiving concomitant medications) compared with the monotherapy phase were: headache (25%), rash (11%), dizziness (10%), diarrhea (8%), dream abnormality (6%), and pruritus (6%). During the monotherapy phase of the double-blind placebo-controlled trials of 18 months' duration, 13% of 227 patients who received lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day), 16% of 190 patients who received placebo, and 23% of 166 patients who received lithium discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuation of lamotrigine were rash (3%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). Approximately 16% of 2,401 patients who received lamotrigine (50 to 500 mg/day) for bipolar disorder in premarketing trials discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction, most commonly due to rash (5%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males, between elderly and nonelderly patients, and among racial groups. Table 12.

Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. cIn the overall bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] . Other reactions that occurred in 5% or more patients but equally or more frequently in the placebo group included: dizziness, mania, headache, infection, influenza, pain, accidental injury, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of less than 5% and greater than 1% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo were: General: Fever, neck pain. Cardiovascular: Migraine. Digestive: Flatulence. Metabolic and Nutritional: Weight gain, edema. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia. Nervous System: Amnesia, depression, agitation, emotional lability, dyspraxia, abnormal thoughts, dream abnormality, hypoesthesia. Respiratory: Sinusitis. Urogenital: Urinary frequency. Adverse Reactions following Abrupt Discontinuation: In the 2 controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, severity, or type of adverse reactions in patients with bipolar disorder after abruptly terminating therapy with lamotrigine. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Mania/Hypomania/Mixed Episodes: During the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials in bipolar I disorder in which adults were converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day) from other psychotropic medications and followed for up to 18 months, the rates of manic or hypomanic or mixed mood episodes reported as adverse reactions were 5% for patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 227), 4% for patients treated with lithium (n = 166), and 7% for patients treated with placebo (n = 190). In all bipolar controlled trials combined, adverse reactions of mania (including hypomania and mixed mood episodes) were reported in 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 956), 3% of patients treated with lithium (n = 280), and 4% of patients treated with placebo (n = 803). 6.2 Other Adverse Reactions Observed in All Clinical Trials Lamotrigine has been administered to 6,694 individuals for whom complete adverse reaction data was captured during all clinical trials, only some of which were placebo controlled. During these trials, all adverse reactions were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse reactions, similar types of adverse reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 6,694 individuals exposed to lamotrigine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving lamotrigine. All reported adverse reactions are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Adverse reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

( 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations should not be exceeded. ( 2.1) Do not restart lamotrigine tablets in patients who discontinued due to rash unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. ( 2.1, 5.1) Adjustments to maintenance doses will be necessary in most patients starting or stopping estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. ( 2.1, 5.7) Discontinuation: Taper over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% dose reduction per week). ( 2.1, 5.8) Epilepsy: Adjunctive therapySee Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Tables 2 and 3 for patients aged 2 to 12 years. ( 2.2) Conversion to monotherapySee Table 4. ( 2.3) Bipolar disorder: See Tables 5 and 6. ( 2.4) 2.1 General Dosing Considerations Rash There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine tablets with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine tablets, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine tablets. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors [ see Boxed Warning] . Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine tablets is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. It is recommended that lamotrigine tablets not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued lamotrigine tablets, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Lamotrigine Tablets Added to Drugs Known to Induce or Inhibit Glucuronidation Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine tablets in patients on estrogen-containing contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 13. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine tablets in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Tables 1, 2, 5-6, and 13. Target Plasma Levels for Patients with Epilepsy or Bipolar Disorder A therapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of lamotrigine tablets should be based on therapeutic response [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives Starting Lamotrigine Tablets in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: Although estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the clearance of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine tablets should be necessary solely based on the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine tablets based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 5, and 7). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of lamotrigine tablets in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of Lamotrigine Tablets in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: (1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , the maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. (2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women taking a stable dose of lamotrigine tablets and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Tables 1 and 5) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to lamotrigine tablets consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking lamotrigine tablets in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine tablets should be necessary. (3) Stopping Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , the maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets will in most cases need to be decreased by as much as 50% in order to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The decrease in dose of lamotrigine tablets should not exceed 25% of the total daily dose per week over a 2-week period, unless clinical response or lamotrigine plasma levels indicate otherwise [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . In women taking lamotrigine tablets in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine tablets should be necessary. Women and Other Hormonal Contraceptive Preparations or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine tablets in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Patients Taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine tablets should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine tablets based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 2, and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of lamotrigine tablets and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of lamotrigine tablets may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added, or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] , the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response. Patients with Renal Impairment Initial doses of lamotrigine tablets should be based on patients' concomitant medications (see Tables 1-3, and 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine tablets. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine tablets should be used with caution in these patients. Discontinuation Strategy Epilepsy: For patients receiving lamotrigine tablets in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed. If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with lamotrigine tablets, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)] . Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine. Bipolar Disorder: In the controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following abrupt termination of lamotrigine tablets. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine tablets. Discontinuation of lamotrigine tablets should involve a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)] . 2.2 EpilepsyAdjunctive Therapy This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients older than 12 years and patients aged 2 to 12 years. Within each of these age-groups, specific dosing recommendations are provided depending upon concomitant AEDs or other concomitant medications (see Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Table 2 for patients aged 2 to 12 years). A weight-based dosing guide for patients aged 2 to 12 years on concomitant valproate is provided in Table 3. Patients Older than 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table 1.

Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)] . Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1),Drug Interactions ( 7), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table 2. Lower starting doses and slower dose escalations than those used in clinical trials are recommended because of the suggestion that the risk of rash may be decreased by lower starting doses and slower dose escalations. Therefore, maintenance doses will take longer to reach in clinical practice than in clinical trials. It may take several weeks to months to achieve an individualized maintenance dose. Maintenance doses in patients weighing less than 30 kg, regardless of age or concomitant AED, may need to be increased as much as 50%, based on clinical response. Table 2.

Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)] .

In patients receiving multidrug regimens employing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone without valproate, maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigine tablets as high as 700 mg/day have been used. In patients receiving valproate alone, maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigine tablets as high as 200 mg/day have been used. The advantage of using doses above those recommended in Tables 1-4 has not been established in controlled trials. 2.3 EpilepsyConversion From Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of lamotrigine tablets. The recommended maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets as monotherapy is 500 mg/day given in 2 divided doses. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for lamotrigine tablets should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning] . Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets After achieving a dose of 500 mg/day of lamotrigine tablets using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme-inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets The conversion regimen involves the 4 steps outlined in Table 4. Table 4. Conversion From Adjunctive Therapy With Valproate to Monotherapy With Lamotrigine Tablets in Patients Aged 16 Years and Older With Epilepsy Lamotrigine Tablets Valproate Step1 Achieveadoseof200mg/dayaccordingto guidelinesinTable1.

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Antiepileptic Drugs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets No specific dosing guidelines can be provided for conversion to monotherapy with lamotrigine tablets with AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate. 2.4 Bipolar Disorder The goal of maintenance treatment with lamotrigine tablets is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage ( 1)] . Patients taking lamotrigine tablets for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Adults The target dose of lamotrigine tablets is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2)] . Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended. Treatment with lamotrigine tablets is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of lamotrigine tablets should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of lamotrigine tablets should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of lamotrigine tablets should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of lamotrigine tablets may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated. If other drugs are subsequently introduced, the dose of lamotrigine tablets may need to be adjusted. In particular, the introduction of valproate requires reduction in the dose of lamotrigine tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations of lamotrigine tablets should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning] . Table 5.

These reactions may be associated with other organ involvement, such as hepatitis, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, or acute multiorgan failure. Lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable dispersible tablets) should be discontinued if alternate etiology for this reaction is not found. (5.2) Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia): May occur, either with or without an associated hypersensitivity syndrome. Monitor for signs of anemia, unexpected infection, or bleeding. (5.3) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. (5.4) Aseptic meningitis: Monitor for signs of meningitis. (5.5) Medication errors due to product name confusion: Strongly advise patients to visually inspect tablets to verify the received drug is correct. (5.6, 16, 17) 5.1. Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning] Pediatric Population The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotriginein a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years)is approximately 0.3% to 0.8%. One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in US and foreign postmarketing experience. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. Adult Population Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. 5.2. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotriginein epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use. Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to ahealthcare providerimmediately. 5.3. Blood Dyscrasias There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.4. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 7 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 7. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients / Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.5. Aseptic Meningitis Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following reinitiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6. Potential Medication Errors Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly. Depictionsof thelamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable dispersible tablets)can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription. 5.7. Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling by the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.8. Withdrawal Seizures As with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials inadults with bipolar disorder, 2patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over a period of at least 2weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.9. Status Epilepticus Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries, etc.) were made. 5.10. Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect. 5.11. Addition of Lamotrigine to a Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.12. Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigines binding to melanin is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.13. Laboratory Tests False-Positive Drug Test Results Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.","contraindication":"4.

Epilepsy Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Clinical Trials: Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with lamotrigine during adjunctive therapy in adults and not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were: dizziness, ataxia, somnolence, headache, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting were dose related. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision occurred more commonly in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Clinical data suggest a higher incidence of rash, including serious rash, in patients receiving concomitant valproate than in patients not receiving valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Approximately 11% of the 3,378 adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (3%), dizziness (2.8%), and headache (2.5%). In a dose-response trial in adults, the rate of discontinuation of lamotrigine for dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting was dose related. Monotherapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine during the monotherapy phase of the controlled trial in adults not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were vomiting, coordination abnormality, dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, rhinitis, anxiety, insomnia, infection, pain, weight decrease, chest pain, and dysmenorrhea. The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions associated with the use of lamotrigine during the conversion to monotherapy (add-on) period, not seen at an equivalent frequency among low-dose valproate-treated patients, were dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, coordination abnormality, vomiting, rash, somnolence, diplopia, ataxia, accidental injury, tremor, blurred vision, insomnia, nystagmus, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, pruritus, and sinusitis. Approximately 10% of the 420 adult patients who received lamotrigine as monotherapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.5%), headache (3.1%), and asthenia (2.4%). Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric Patients with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years and not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were infection, vomiting, rash, fever, somnolence, accidental injury, dizziness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, ataxia, tremor, asthenia, bronchitis, flu syndrome, and diplopia. In 339 patients aged 2 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures or generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 4.2% of patients on lamotrigine and 2.9% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reaction that led to discontinuation of lamotrigine was rash. Approximately 11.5% of the 1,081 pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.4%), reaction aggravated (1.7%), and ataxia (0.6%). Controlled Adjunctive Clinical Trials in Adults with Epilepsy: Table 8 lists adverse reactions that occurred in adult patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials. In thesetrials, either lamotrigine or placebo was added to the patients current AED therapy. Table 8.

Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. In a randomized, parallel trial comparing placebo with 300and 500mg/day of lamotrigine, some of the more common drug-related adverse reactions were dose related (see Table 9). Table 9. Dose-Related Adverse Reactions from a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Adjunctive Trial in Adults with Epilepsy Percent of Patients Experiencing Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Placebo (n = 73) Lamotrigine 300 mg (n = 71) Lamotrigine 500 mg (n = 72) Ataxia Blurred vision Diplopia Dizziness Nausea Vomiting 10 10 8 27 11 4 10 11 24a 31 18 11 28a,b 25 a,b 49 a,b 54 a,b 25 a 18 a a Significantly greater than placebo group (p<0.05). b Significantly greater than group receiving lamotrigine 300 mg (p<0.05). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males, and was independent of age. Because the largest non-Caucasian racial subgroup was only 6% of patients exposed to lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reaction reports by race. Generally, females receiving either lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or placebo were more likely to report adverse reactions than males. The only adverse reaction for which the reports on lamotrigine were greater than 10% more frequent in females than males (without a corresponding difference by gender on placebo) was dizziness (difference=16.5%). There was little difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of lamotrigine for individual adverse reactions. Controlled Monotherapy Trial in Adults with Partial-Onset Seizures: Table 10 lists adverse reactions that occurred in patients with epilepsy treated with monotherapy with lamotrigine in a double-blind trial following discontinuation of either concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin not seen at an equivalent frequency in the control group.

Bipolar Disorder in Adults The most common adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as monotherapy (100 to 400mg/day) in adult patients (aged 18 to 82years) with bipolar disorder in the 2double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 18months duration are included in Table 12. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients and were numerically more frequent during the dose-escalation phase of lamotrigine in these trials (when patients may have been receiving concomitant medications) compared with the monotherapy phase were: headache (25%), rash (11%), dizziness (10%), diarrhea (8%), dream abnormality (6%), and pruritus (6%). During the monotherapy phase of the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 18months duration, 13% of 227 patients who received lamotrigine (100 to 400mg/day), 16% of 190patients who received placebo, and 23% of 166 patients who received lithium discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactionsthat most commonly led to discontinuation of lamotrigine were rash (3%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). Approximately 16% of 2,401 patients who received lamotrigine (50 to 500mg/day) for bipolar disorder in premarketing trials discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction; most commonly due to rash (5%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males, between elderly and nonelderly patients, and among racial groups. Table 12.

Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. cIn the overall bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Other reactions that occurred in 5% or more patients but equally or more frequently in the placebo group included: dizziness, mania, headache, infection, influenza, pain, accidental injury, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of less than 5% and greater than 1% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo were: General: Fever, neck pain. Cardiovascular: Migraine. Digestive: Flatulence. Metabolic and Nutritional: Weight gain, edema. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia. Nervous System:Amnesia, depression, agitation, emotional lability, dyspraxia, abnormal thoughts, dream abnormality, hypoesthesia. Respiratory: Sinusitis. Urogenital: Urinary frequency. Adverse Reactions following Abrupt Discontinuation: In the 2controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, severity or type of adverse reactions in patients withbipolar disorder after abruptly terminating therapy with lamotrigine. In the clinical development program inadults with bipolar disorder, 2patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Mania/Hypomania/Mixed Episodes: During the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in bipolar I disorder in which adults were converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400mg/day) from other psychotropic medications and followed for up to 18months, the rates of manic or hypomanic or mixed mood episodes reported as adverse reactions were 5% for patients treated with lamotrigine (n=227), 4% for patients treated with lithium (n=166), and 7% for patients treated with placebo (n=190). In all bipolar controlled trials combined, adverse reactions of mania (including hypomania and mixed mood episodes) were reported in 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine (n=956), 3% of patients treated with lithium (n=280), and 4% of patients treated with placebo (n=803). 6.2. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in All Clinical Trials Lamotrigine has been administered to 6,694 individuals for whom complete adverse reaction data was captured during all clinical trials, only some of which were placebo controlled. During these trials, all adverse reactions were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse reactions, similar types of adverse reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 6,694 individuals exposed to lamotrigine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least1 occasion while receiving lamotrigine. All reported adverse reactions are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Adverse reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosing is based on concomitant medications, indication, and patient age. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations should not be exceeded. (2.1) Do not restart lamotriginein patients who discontinued due to rash unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. (2.1, 5.1) Adjustments to maintenance doses will be necessary in most patients starting or stopping estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. (2.1, 5.7) Discontinuation: Taper over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% dose reduction per week). (2.1, 5.8) Epilepsy: Adjunctive therapy - See Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Tables 2 and 3 for patients aged 2 to 12 years. (2.2) Conversion to monotherapy - See Table 4. (2.3) Bipolar disorder: See Tables 5 and 6. (2.4) 2.1. General Dosing Considerations Rash There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors [see Boxed Warning]. Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. It is recommended that lamotrigine not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine, unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued lamotrigine, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. L amotrigine Added to Drugs Known to Induce or Inhibit Glucuronidation Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for lamotriginein patients on estrogen-containing contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 13. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Table 1,2,5,6, and13. Target Plasma Levels for Patients with Epilepsy or Bipolar Disorder Atherapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of lamotrigine should be based on therapeutic response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives Starting L amotrigine in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: Although estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the clearance of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine should be necessary solely based on the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Table 1, 5, and 7). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of lamotrigine in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of Lamotriginein Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: (1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of lamotrigine will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance doseto maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. (2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:In women taking a stable dose of lamotrigine and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold,to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Tables 1and 5) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to lamotrigine consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking lamotrigine in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine should be necessary. (3) Stopping Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of lamotrigine will in most cases need to be decreased by as much as 50%, in order to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The decrease in dose of lamotrigine should not exceed 25% of the total daily dose per week over a 2-week period, unless clinical response or lamotrigine plasma levels indicate otherwise [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].In women taking lamotrigine in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine should be necessary. Women and Other Hormonal Contraceptive Preparations or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotriginein the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Patients Taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 2, and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of lamotrigine and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of lamotrigine may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added, or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response. Patients with Renal Impairment Initial doses of lamotrigine should be based on patients' concomitant medications (see Tables 1 to 3,and 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine should be used with caution in these patients. Discontinuation Strategy Epilepsy: For patients receiving lamotrigine in combination with other AEDs, a reevaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed. If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with lamotrigine, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine. Bipolar Disorder: In the controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following abrupt termination of lamotrigine. In the clinical development programinadults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Discontinuation of lamotrigine should involve a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 2.2. Epilepsy-Adjunctive Therapy This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients older than 12years and patients aged 2 to 12years. Within each of these age-groups, specific dosing recommendations are provided depending upon concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Table 2 for patients aged 2 to 12 years). A weight-based dosing guide for patients aged 2 to 12 years on concomitant valproate is provided in Table 3. Patients Older than 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Escalation Regimen for Lamotrigine in Patients Older than 12 Years with Epilepsy In Patients TAKING Valproatea InPatients NOT TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidoneb, or Valproatea In Patients TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidoneb and NOT TAKING Valproatea Weeks 1 and 2 25 mg every other day 25 mg every day 50 mg/day Weeks 3 and 4 25 mg every day 50 mg/day 100 mg/day (in 2 divided doses) Week 5 onwards to maintenance Increase by 25 to 50mg/day every 1 to 2weeks Increase by 50mg/day every 1 to 2weeks Increase by 100mg/day every 1 to 2weeks. Usual Maintenance Dose 100 to 200mg/day with valproate alone 100 to 400mg/day with valproate and other drugs that induce glucuronication ( in 1 or 2 divided doses) 225 to 375mg/day (in 2 divided doses). 300 to 500mg/day (in 2 divided doses). a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table2. Lower starting doses and slower dose escalations than those used in clinical trials are recommended because of the suggestions that the risk of rash may be decreased bylower starting doses and slower dose escalations. Therefore, maintenance doses will take longer to reach in clinical practice than in clinical trials. It may take several weeks to months to achieve an individualized maintenance dose. Maintenance doses in patients weighing less than 30kg, regardless of age or concomitant AED, may need to be increased as much as 50%, based on clinical response. The smallest available strength oflamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable dispersible tablets)is 2 mg, and only whole tablets should be administered. If the calculated dose cannot be achieved using whole tablets, the dose should be rounded down to the nearest whole tablet [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Medication Guide]. Table 2. Escalation Regimen for Lamotrigine in Patients Aged 2 to 12 Yearswith Epilepsy InPatients TAKING Valproatea In Patients NOT TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidoneb, Valproatea For Patients TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidoneb and NOT TAKING Valproatea Weeks 1 and 2 0.15mg/kg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet (see Table3 for weight based dosing guide) 0.3 mg/kg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet 0.6 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet Weeks 3 and 4 0.3 mg/kg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet (see Table3 for weight based dosing guide) 0.6 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet 1.2 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses, rounded down to the nearest whole tablet Week 5 onwards to maintenance The dose should be increased every 1 to 2 weeks as follows: calculate 0.3 mg/kg/day, round this amount down to the nearest whole tablet, and add this amount to the previously administered daily dose The dose should be increased every 1 to 2 weeks as follows: calculate 0.6 mg/kg/day, round this amount down to the nearest whole tablet, and add this amount to the previously administered daily dose The dose should be increased every 1 to 2 weeks as follows: calculate 1.2 mg/kg/day, round this amount down to the nearest whole tablet, and add this amount to the previously administered daily dose Usual Maintenance Dose 1 to 5mg/kg/day(maximum 200mg/day in 1 or 2divided doses). 1 to 3 mg/kg/daywith valproate alone 4.5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day in 2 divided doses) 5 to 15 mg/kg/day (maximum 400mg/day in 2 divided doses) Maintenance dose in patients less than 30kg May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response Note: Only whole tablets should be used for dosing. a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 3. The Initial Weight-Based Dosing Guide for Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Taking Valproate (Weeks 1 to 4) with Epilepsy If the patients weight is Give this daily dose, using the most appropriate combination of lamotrigine 2 and 5-mg tablets Greater than And less than Weeks 1 and 2 Weeks 3 and 4 6.7 kg 14 kg 2 mg every other day 2 mg every day 14.1 kg 27 kg 2 mg every day 4 mg every day 27.1 kg 34 kg 4 mg every day 8 mg every day 34.1 kg 40 kg 5 mg every day 10 mg every day Usual Adjunctive Maintenance Dose for Epilepsy The usual maintenance doses identified in Tables 1 and 2 are derived from dosing regimens employed in the placebo-controlled adjunctivetrials in which the efficacy of lamotriginewas established. In patients receiving multidrug regimens employing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone without valproate, maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigineas high as 700mg/day have been used. In patients receiving valproate alone, maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigineas high as 200mg/day have been used. The advantage of using doses above those recommended in Tables 1to 4 has not been established in controlled trials. 2.3. Epilepsy-Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of lamotrigine. The recommended maintenance dose of lamotrigine as monotherapy is 500mg/day given in 2 divided doses. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for lamotrigine should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning]. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine After achieving a dose of 500mg/day of lamotrigine using the guidelines in Table1, the concomitant AED enzyme-inducingshould be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine The conversion regimen involves the 4steps outlined in Table 4. Table 4. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotriginein Patients Aged 16 Years and Older with Epilepsy Lamotrigine Valproate Step 1 Achieve a dose of 200mg/day according to guidelines in Table 1. Maintain established stable dose. Step 2 Maintain at 200mg/day. Decrease dose by decrements no greater than 500 mg/day/week to 500 mg/day and then maintain for 1 week. Step 3 Increase to 300mg/day and maintain for 1 week. Simultaneously decrease to 250 mg/day and maintain for 1 week. Step 4 Increase by 100mg/day every week to achieve maintenance dose of 500mg/day. Discontinue. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with AEDs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine No specific dosing guidelines can be provided for conversion to monotherapy with lamotriginewith AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital,primidone, or valproate. 2.4. Bipolar Disorder The goal of maintenance treatment with lamotrigine is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients taking lamotrigine for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Adults The target dose of lamotrigine is 200mg/day (100mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400mg/day compared with 200mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended. Treatment with lamotrigine is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of lamotrigine should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of lamotrigine should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of lamotrigine should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of lamotrigine may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated. If other drugs are subsequently introduced, the dose of lamotrigine may need to be adjusted. In particular, the introduction of valproate requires reduction in the dose of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations of lamotrigine should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning]. Table 5. Escalation Regimen for Lamotrigine in Adults with Bipolar Disorder In Patients TAKING Valproatea In Patients NOT TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidoneb, or Valproatea In Patients TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidoneb and NOT TAKING Valproatea Weeks 1 and 2 25mg every otherday 25 mg daily 50mg daily Weeks 3 and 4 25mg daily 50mg daily 100mg daily, in divided doses Week 5 50mg daily 100mg daily 200mg daily, in divided doses Week 6 100mg daily 200mg daily 300mg daily, in divided doses Week 7 100mg daily 200mg daily up to 400mg daily, in divided doses a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 6.

Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5. Administration of Lamotrigine Tablets for Oral Suspension (Chewable Dispersible Tablets) Lamotriginemay be swallowed whole, chewed, or dispersed in water or diluted fruit juice. If the tablets are chewed, consume a small amount of water or diluted fruit juice to aid in swallowing. To disperse lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable dispersible tablets), add the tablets to a small amount of liquid (1 teaspoon, or enough to cover the medication). Approximately 1 minute later, when the tablets are completely dispersed, swirl the solution and consume the entire quantity immediately. No attempt should be made to administer partial quantities of the dispersed tablets.","activeIngredient":3090839},{"uuid":"52817-242","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Lamotrigine Extended Release","proprietaryName":"TruPharma, LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are indicated for: adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 13 years and older.

(Boxed Warning, 5.1) Fatal or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, may be fatal or life threatening. Early signs may include rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. These reactions may be associated with other organ involvement, such as hepatitis, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, or acute multiorgan failure. LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be discontinued if alternate etiology for this reaction is not found. (5.2) Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia): May occur, either with or without an associated hypersensitivity syndrome. Monitor for signs of anemia, unexpected infection, or bleeding. (5.3 ) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. (5.4) Aseptic meningitis: Monitor for signs of meningitis. (5.5) Medication errors due to product name confusion: Strongly advise patients to visually inspect tablets to verify the received drug is correct. (5.6, 16, 17) 5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning] The risk of serious rash caused by treatment with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is not expected to differ from that with immediate-release lamotrigine [see Boxed Warning]. However, the relatively limited treatment experience with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS makes it difficult to characterize the frequency and risk of serious rashes caused by treatment with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. Pediatric Population The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy receiving adjunctive therapy with immediate-release lamotrigine was approximately 0.8% (16 of 1,983). When 14 of these cases were reviewed by 3 expert dermatologists, there was considerable disagreement as to their proper classification. To illustrate, one dermatologist considered none of the cases to be Stevens-Johnson syndrome; another assigned 7 of the 14 to this diagnosis. There was 1 rash-related death in this 1,983-patient cohort. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in US and foreign postmarketing experience. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are not approved in patients younger than 13 years Adult Population Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received immediate-release lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered immediate-release lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered immediate-release lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. Patients With History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. 5.2 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use. Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Prior to initiation of treatment with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately. 5.3 Blood Dyscrasias There have been reports of blood dyscrasias with immediate-release lamotrigine that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.4 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation AEDs, including LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients With Events Per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients With Events Per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients With Events Per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Potential Medication Errors Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS clearly. Depictions of the LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS can be found in the Medication Guide. Each LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLET has a distinct color and distinct imprint. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles containing 30 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS and the specific tablet strength included in the bottle. The unit-of-use bottle with a distinctive bottle label features serves to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help to reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS each time they fill their prescription. 5.7 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.8 Withdrawal Seizures As with other AEDs, LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.9 Status Epilepticus Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with immediate-release lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made. 5.10 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) During the premarketing development of immediate-release lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for immediate-release lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving immediate-release lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving immediate-release lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect. 5.11 Addition of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS to a Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2), Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.12 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in 1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigines binding to melanin is unknown. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.13 Laboratory Tests False-Positive Drug Test Results Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 6), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary. Effect on Leukocytes Treatment with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS caused an increased incidence of subnormal (below the reference range) values in some hematology analytes (e.g., total white blood cells, monocytes). The treatment effect (LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS % - Placebo %) incidence of subnormal counts was 3% for total white blood cells and 4% for monocytes.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity (e.g., rash, angioedema, acute urticaria, extensive pruritus, mucosal ulceration) to the drug or its ingredients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

In these 2 trials, adverse reactions led to withdrawal of 4 (2%) patients in the group receiving placebo and 10 (5%) patients in the group receiving LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. Dizziness was the most common reason for withdrawal in the group receiving LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (5 patients [3%]). The next most common adverse reactions leading to withdrawal in 2 patients each (1%) were rash, headache, nausea, and nystagmus. Table 4 displays the incidence of adverse reactions in these two 19-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with PGTC and partial-onset seizures. Table 4.

These persistent adverse reactions included somnolence and dizziness There were inadequate data to evaluate the effect of dose and/or concentration on the incidence of adverse reactions because, although patients were randomized to different target doses based upon concomitant AEDs, the plasma exposure was expected to be generally similar among all patients receiving different doses. However, in a randomized, parallel trial comparing placebo with 300 and 500 mg/day of immediate-release lamotrigine, the incidence of the most common adverse reactions (5%) such as ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia, and dizziness were dose related. Less common adverse reactions (2% of patients receiving immediate-release lamotrigine and more frequently than in the placebo group. Body as a Whole: Chest pain.

Tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed, or divided. Do not exceed the recommended initial dosage and subsequent dose escalation. (2.1) Initiation of adjunctive therapy and conversion to monotherapy requires slow titration dependent on concomitant AEDs; the prescriber must refer to the appropriate algorithm in Dosage and Administration. (2.2, 2.3) Adjunctive therapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 200 to 600 mg daily and is dependent on concomitant AEDs. (2.2) Conversion to monotherapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 250 to 300 mg daily. (2.3) Conversion from immediate-release lamotrigine to LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS: The initial dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should match the total daily dose of the immediate-release lamotrigine. Patients should be closely monitored for seizure control after conversion. (2.4) Do not restart LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients who discontinued due to rash unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. (2.1, 5.1) Adjustments to maintenance doses will be necessary in most patients starting or stopping estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. (2.1, 5.7) Discontinuation: Taper over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% dose reduction per week). (2.1, 5.8) 2.1 General Dosing Considerations Rash There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors [see Boxed Warning]. Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. It is recommended that LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS Added to Drugs Known to Induce or Inhibit Glucuronidation Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients on estrogen-containing contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 5. For dosing considerations for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Table 1 and Table 5. Target Plasma Levels A therapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be based on therapeutic response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives Starting LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: Although estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the clearance of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be necessary solely based on the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Table 1). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: (1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. (2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women taking a stable dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Table 1) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be necessary. (3) Stopping Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS will in most cases need to be decreased by as much as 50% in order to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The decrease in dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should not exceed 25% of the total daily dose per week over a 2-week period, unless clinical response or lamotrigine plasma levels indicate otherwise [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In women taking LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be necessary. Women and Other Hormonal Contraceptive Preparations or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Patients Taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1 and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added, or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response. Patients with Renal Impairment Initial doses of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be based on patients concomitant medications (see Table 1); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with immediate-release lamotrigine. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should be used with caution in these patients. Discontinuation Strategy For patients receiving LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed. If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine. 2.2 Adjunctive Therapy for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic and Partial-Onset Seizures This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients aged 13 years and older. Specific dosing recommendations are provided depending upon concomitant AEDs or other concomitant medications. Table 1. Escalation Regimen for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in Patients Aged 13 Years and Older In Patients TAKING Valproatea In Patients NOT TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primodone,b or Valproatea In Patients TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidoneb and NOT TAKING or Valproatea Weeks 1 and 2 25 mg every other day 25 mg every day 50 mg every day Weeks 3 and 4 25 mg every day 50 mg every day 100 mg every day Week 5 50 mg every day 100 mg every day 200 mg every day Week 6 100 mg every day 150 mg every day 300 mg every day Week 7 150 mg every day 200 mg every day 400 mg every day Maintenance range (week 8 and onward) 200 to 250 mg every dayc 300 to 400 mg every dayc 400 to 600 mg every dayc a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. bDrugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 )]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. cDose increases at week 8 or later should not exceed 100 mg daily at weekly intervals. 2.3 Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended maintenance dosage range of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS as monotherapy is 250 to 300 mg given once daily. The recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning]. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS After achieving a dose of 500 mg/day of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme-inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. Two weeks after completion of withdrawal of the enzyme-inducing AED, the dosage of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may be decreased no faster than 100 mg/day each week to achieve the monotherapy maintenance dosage range of 250 to 300 mg/day. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial using immediate-release lamotrigine. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy With LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS The conversion regimen involves the 4 steps outlined in Table 2. Table 2. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in Patients Aged 13 Years and Older with Epilepsy LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS Valproate Step 1 Achieve a dose of 150 mg/day according to guidelines in Table 1. Maintain established stable dose. Step 2 Maintain at 150 mg/day. Decrease dose by decrements no greater than 500 mg/day/week to 500 mg/day and then maintain for 1 week. Step 3 Increase to 200 mg/day. Simultaneously decrease to 250 mg/day and maintain for 1 week. Step 4 Increase to 250 or 300 mg/day. Discontinue. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Antiepileptic Drugs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS After achieving a dosage of 250 to 300 mg/day of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. No adjustment to the monotherapy dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is needed. 2.4 Conversion from Immediate-Release Lamotrigine Tablets to LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS Patients may be converted directly from immediate-release lamotrigine to LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. The initial dose of LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS should match the total daily dose of immediate-release lamotrigine. However, some subjects on concomitant enzyme-inducing agents may have lower plasma levels of lamotrigine on conversion and should be monitored [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Following conversion to LAMOTRIGINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, all patients (but especially those on drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation) should be closely monitored for seizure control [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Depending on the therapeutic response after conversion, the total daily dose may need to be adjusted within the recommended dosing instructions (see Table 1).","activeIngredient":3110378},{"uuid":"55513-073","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Sensipar","proprietaryName":"Amgen Inc","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sensipar is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist indicated for: Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.(1.1) Limitations of Use:Sensipar is not indicated for use in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis Hypercalcemia in adult patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma (PC).

Hypocalcemia can prolong QT interval, lower the threshold for seizures, and cause hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia. Monitor serum calcium carefully for the occurrence of hypocalcemia during treatment (2.4, 5.1) Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: Patients with risk factors for upper GI bleeding may be at increased risk. Monitor patients and promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding. (5.2) Hypotension, Worsening Heart Failure and/or Arrhythmias: Inpostmarketing safety surveillance, isolated, idiosyncratic cases of hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function. (5.3) Adynamic B one D isease: May develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100pg/mL. (5.4) 5.1 Hypocalcemia Sensipar lowers serum calcium and can lead to hypocalcemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Significant lowering of serum calcium can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar, including in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Sensipar have not been established in pediatric patients[see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 )]. Sensipar is not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis[see I ndications and Usage ( 1 )]. In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis, the longterm safety and efficacy of Sensipar have not been established. Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with Sensipar-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels. In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of Sensipar-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value <8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo. QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar.Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to Sensipar. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving Sensipar. Seizures In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of Sensipar-treatedpatients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treatedpatients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving Sensipar. Concurrent administration of Sensipar with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving Sensipar and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels. Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Sensipar dose reduction or discontinuation of Sensipar may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.2 Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, mostly upper gastrointestinal bleeding, have occurred in patients using calcimimetics, including Sensipar, from postmarketing and clinical trial sources. The exact cause of GI bleeding in these patients is unknown. Patients with risk factors for upper GI bleeding (such as known gastritis, esophagitis, ulcers or severe vomiting) may be at increased risk for GI bleeding when receiving Sensipar treatment. Monitor patients for worsening of common GI adverse reactions of nausea and vomiting associated with Sensipar [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] and for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and ulcerations during Sensipar therapy. Promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding. 5.3 Hypotension, Worsening Heart Failure and/or Arrhythmias In postmarketing safety surveillance, isolated, idiosyncratic cases of hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function, in which a causal relationship to Sensipar could not be completely excluded and which may be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100pg/mL. One clinical study evaluated bone histomorphometry in patients treated with Sensipar for 1 year. Three patients with mild hyperparathyroid bone disease at the beginning of the study developed adynamic bone disease during treatment with Sensipar. Two of these patients had iPTH levels below 100pg/mL at multiple time points during the study. In three 6-month, phase 3 studies conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis, 11% of patients treated with Sensipar had mean iPTH values below 100pg/mL during the efficacy-assessment phase. If iPTH levels decrease below 150pg/mL in patients treated with Sensipar, the dose of Sensipar and/or vitamin D sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Sensipar treatment initiation is contraindicated if serum calcium is less than the lower limit of the normal range [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].

Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis In three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 1126 patients with CKD on dialysis received study drug (656 Sensipar, 470 placebo) for up to 6 months. The most frequently reported adverse reactionsare listed in Table 1.

Patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism The safety profile of Sensipar in these patient populations is generally consistent with that seen in patients with CKD on dialysis. Forty six patients were treated with Sensipar in a single arm study, 29 with Parathyroid Carcinoma and 17 with intractable pHPT. Nine (20%) of the patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse reactions and the most frequent cause of withdrawal in these patient populations were nausea and vomiting. Severe or prolonged cases of nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration and worsening hypercalcemia so careful monitoring of electrolytes is recommended in patients with these symptoms. Eight patients died during treatment with Sensipar in this study, 7 with Parathyroid Carcinoma (24%) and 1 (6%) with intractable pHPT. Causes of death were cardiovascular (5 patients), multi-organ failure (1 patient), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1patient) and metastatic carcinoma (1 patient). Adverse events of hypocalcemia were reported in three patients (7%). Seizures were observed in 0.7% (1/140) of cinacalcet-treated patients and 0.0% (0/46) of placebo-treated patients in all clinical studies. Table 3.

Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis in which patients were treated for up to 64 months (mean duration of treatment was 21 months in the cinacalcet group), 75% of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 29% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL and 33% of cinacalcet patients compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most of the cases of severe hypocalcemia less than 7.5 mg/dL (21/33=64%) occurred during the first 6 months. In this trial, 1.1% of patients receiving Sensipar and 0.1% of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia. During a placebo-controlled part of a 52-week study in patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (>11.3 mg/dL[2.82mmol/L] and 12.5 mg/dL[3.12mmol/L]), serum calcium less than 8.4 mg/dL was observed in 6.1% (2/33) of Sensipar treated patients and 0% (0/34) of placebo treated patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Sensipar. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions has been endoscopically demonstrated at the end of a 12-week trial using doses of 15 mg q.i.d. As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis): Metoclopramide tablets, USP are indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis. The usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g., nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals, and anorexia) appear to respond to metoclopramide within different time intervals. Significant relief of nausea occurs early and continues to improve over a three-week period. Relief of vomiting and anorexia may precede the relief of abdominal fullness by one week or more.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.

The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency. CNS Effects: Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg q.i.d. (see PRECAUTIONS). Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation (see WARNINGS) occur less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clearcut relationships to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS): Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and, rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot-tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, altered consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (see WARNINGS). Endocrine Disturbances: Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTIONS). Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure and possible AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Gastrointestinal: Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic: Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal: Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic: A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clearcut relationships to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE). Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults.

For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux: Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg metoclopramide hydrochloride, USP orally up to q.i.d. 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and INDICATIONS AND USAGE). If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose. Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using q.i.d. therapy at 15 mg per dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation. Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended. For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis) Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation. The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration). Administration of the metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside, at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation. Use in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate. See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis. Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.","activeIngredient":3058005},{"uuid":"76237-299","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Metoclopramide","proprietaryName":"McKesson Contract Packager","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE The use of metoclopramide tablets is recommended for adults only.

However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration). Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside, at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide tablet, USP therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation. Use in Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate. See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis. Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.","activeIngredient":3111829},{"uuid":"63629-5292","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"BRILINTA","proprietaryName":"Bryant Ranch Prepack","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BRILINTA is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or ST elevation myocardial infarction).

Avoid maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Like other antiplatelet agents, BRILINTA increases the risk of bleeding. (5.1) In PLATO, use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of BRILINTA. (5.2, 14) Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.3) Dyspnea: Dyspnea was reported more frequently with BRILINTA than with clopidogrel. Dyspnea resulting from BRILINTA is self-limiting. Rule out other causes. (5.4) Discontinuation of BRILINTA: Premature discontinuation increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and death. (5.5) 5.1 General Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including BRILINTA increase the risk of bleeding. BRILINTA increased the overall risk of bleeding (Major + Minor) to a somewhat greater extent than did clopidogrel. The increase was seen for non-CABG-related bleeding, but not for CABG-related bleeding. Fatal and life-threatening bleeding rates were not increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In general, risk factors for bleeding include older age, a history of bleeding disorders, performance of percutaneous invasive procedures, and concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy, higher doses of aspirin, and chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]). When possible, discontinue BRILINTA five days prior to surgery. Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures, even if the patient does not have any signs of bleeding. If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose In PLATO, use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of BRILINTA. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use BRILINTA with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.3 Moderate Hepatic Impairment BRILINTA has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. 5.4 Dyspnea In PLATO, dyspnea was reported in 14% of patients treated with BRILINTA and in 8% of patients taking clopidogrel. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment, but occasionally required discontinuation (0.9% of patients taking BRILINTA versus 0.1% of patients taking clopidogrel). If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea during treatment with BRILINTA, exclude underlying diseases that may require treatment. If dyspnea is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. In a substudy, 199 patients from PLATO underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for FEV1. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. 5.5 Discontinuation of BRILINTA Avoid interruption of BRILINTA treatment. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for elective surgery), restart it as soon as possible. Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and death. 5.6 Strong Inhibitors of Cytochrome CYP3A Ticagrelor is metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Cytochrome CYP3A Potent Inducers Avoid use with potent CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of intracranial hemorrhage (4.1) Active pathological bleeding (4.2) Severe hepatic impairment (4.3) Hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or any component of the product (4.4) 4.1 History of Intracranial Hemorrhage BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) because of a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 4.2 Active Bleeding BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 4.3 Severe Hepatic Impairment BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment because of a probable increase in exposure, and it has not been studied in these patients. Severe hepatic impairment increases the risk of bleeding because of reduced synthesis of coagulation proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 4.4 Hypersensitivity BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g. angioedema) to ticagrelor or any component of the product [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )].","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING BRILINTA (ticagrelor) 90 mg is supplied as a round, biconvex, yellow, film-coated tablet marked with a 90 above T on one side.

BRILINTA has been evaluated for safety in more than 10000 patients, including more than 3000 patients treated for more than 1 year. Bleeding PLATO used the following bleeding severity categorization: Major bleed fatal/life-threatening. Any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial bleed with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension due to bleeding and requiring pressors or surgery; clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) of more than 5 g/dL; transfusion of 4 or more units (whole blood or packed red blood cells (PRBCs)) for bleeding. Major bleed other. Any one of the following: significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with a decrease in Hb of 3 g/dL; transfusion of 2-3 units (whole blood or PRBCs) for bleeding. Minor bleed. Requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding (e.g., epistaxis requiring visit to medical facility for packing). Minimal bleed. All others (e.g., bruising, bleeding gums, oozing from injection sites, etc.) not requiring intervention or treatment. Figure 1 shows major bleeding events over time. Many events are early, at a time of coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, and other procedures, but the risk persists during later use of antiplatelet therapy. Figure 1- Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first PLATO-defined Total Major bleeding event Annualized rates of bleeding are summarized in Table 1 below. About half of the bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 - Non-CABG related bleeds (KM%) BRILINTA N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 Total (Major + Minor) 8.7 7.0 Major 4.5 3.8 Fatal/Life-threatening 2.1 1.9 Fatal 0.2 0.2 Intracranial (Fatal/Life-threatening) 0.3 0.2 As shown in Table 1, BRILINTA was associated with a somewhat greater risk of non- CABG bleeding than was clopidogrel. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Table 2. Rates were very high but similar for BRILINTA and clopidogrel. Table 2 - CABG bleeds (KM%) Patients with CABG BRILINTA N=770 Clopidogrel N=814 Total Major 85.8 86.9 Fatal/Life-threatening 48.1 47.9 Fatal 0.9 1.1 Although the platelet inhibition effect of BRILINTA has a faster offset than clopidogrel in in vitro tests and BRILINTA is a reversibly binding P2Y12 inhibitor, PLATO did not show an advantage of BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel for CABG-related bleeding. When antiplatelet therapy was stopped 5 days before CABG, major bleeding occurred in 75% of BRILINTA treated patients and 79% on clopidogrel. No data exist with BRILINTA regarding a hemostatic benefit of platelet transfusions. Drug Discontinuation In PLATO, the rate of study drug discontinuation attributed to adverse reactions was 7.4% for BRILINTA and 5.4% for clopidogrel. Bleeding caused permanent discontinuation of study drug in 2.3% of BRILINTA patients and 1.0% of clopidogrel patients. Dyspnea led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% of BRILINTA and 0.1% of clopidogrel patients. Common Adverse Events A variety of non-hemorrhagic adverse events occurred in PLATO at rates of 3% or more. These are shown in Table 3. In the absence of a placebo control, whether these are drug related cannot be determined in most cases, except where they are more common on BRILINTA or clearly related to the drugs pharmacologic effect (dyspnea).

PLATO excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). In PLATO, syncope, pre-syncope and loss of consciousness were reported by 1.7% and 1.5% of BRILINTA and clopidogrel patients, respectively. In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6% respectively after 1 month. Gynecomastia In PLATO, gynecomastia was reported by 0.23% of men on BRILINTA and 0.05% on clopidogrel.Other sex-hormonal adverse reactions, including sex organ malignancies, did not differ between the two treatment groups in PLATO. Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: Serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel in PLATO. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BRILINTA.

Patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk: Use initially with cyclosporine (CsA) and corticosteroids. CsA withdrawal is recommended 2-4 months after transplantation ( 1.1 ). Patients at high-immunologic risk: Use in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first 12 months following transplantation ( 1.1 ). Safety and efficacy of CsA withdrawal has not been established in high risk patients ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 14.3 ). Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended for all patients ( 2.3 , 5.14 ). 1.1 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Renal Transplantation Rapamune (sirolimus) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years or older receiving renal transplants. Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving Rapamune [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, it is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in a regimen with cyclosporine and corticosteroids; cyclosporine should be withdrawn 2 to 4 months after transplantation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In patients at high-immunologic risk (defined as Black recipients and/or repeat renal transplant recipients who lost a previous allograft for immunologic reason and/or patients with high panel-reactive antibodies [PRA; peak PRA level > 80%]), it is recommended that Rapamune be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year following transplantation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 1.2 Limitations of Use Cyclosporine withdrawal has not been studied in patients with Banff Grade 3 acute rejection or vascular rejection prior to cyclosporine withdrawal, those who are dialysis-dependent, those with serum creatinine > 4.5 mg/dL, Black patients, patients of multi-organ transplants, secondary transplants, or those with high levels of panel-reactive antibodies [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In patients at high-immunologic risk, the safety and efficacy of Rapamune used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids has not been studied beyond one year; therefore after the first 12 months following transplantation, any adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered on the basis of the clinical status of the patient [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In pediatric patients, the safety and efficacy of Rapamune have not been established in patients < 13 years old, or in pediatric (< 18 years) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk [see Adverse Reactions (6.5), Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine have not been established in renal transplant patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions ( 5.4 ) Angioedema ( 5.5 ) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing ( 5.6 ) Hyperlipidemia ( 5.7 ) Renal Function ( 5.8 ) Proteinuria ( 5.9 ) Interstitial Lung Disease ( 5.10 ) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine ( 5.11 ) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for Rapamune-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increasesusceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Rapamune. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.3 Lung Transplantation Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.5 Angioedema Rapamune has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Rapamune with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving Rapamune. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with Rapamune compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43-46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45-57%) in patients receiving Rapamune compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune. Any patient who is administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and/or fibrates appeared to be well-tolerated. During Rapamune therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of Rapamune with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and Rapamune were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving Rapamune and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of Rapamune and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, Rapamune may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients 6-120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to Rapamune compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to Rapamune conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion.New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the Rapamune conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the Rapamune conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of Rapamune. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.11 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.12 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.13 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.14 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring The label-recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. These concentration values are not interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.16 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of Rapamune with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rapamune is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received Rapamune Oral Solution 2 mg/day, 208 received Rapamune Oral Solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data ( 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the Rapamune treatment groups with an incidence of 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of Rapamune were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol< 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both Rapamune 2 mg and Rapamune 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 4252% of patients enrolled in the Rapamune arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg Rapamune groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving Rapamune plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the Rapamune with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with Rapamune. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Rapamune in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In an ongoing study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12-20 ng/mL, and then 8-20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the Rapamune treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the Rapamune conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatrics Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Rapamune. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole Lymphedema. Cardiovascular Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults). Hematological/Lymphatic The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Infections Tuberculosis. Metabolic/Nutritional Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia. Respiratory Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis Skin Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Urogenital Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Azoospermia has been reported with the use of Rapamune and has been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases.","drugClass":"sirolimus","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Rapamune is to be administered orally once daily, consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tablets should not be crushed, chewed or split. Patients unable to take the tablets should be prescribed the solution and instructed in its use. The initial dose of Rapamune should be administered as soon as possible after transplantation. It is recommended that Rapamune be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and or/cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Frequent Rapamune dose adjustments based on non-steady-state sirolimus concentrations can lead to overdosing or underdosing because sirolimus has a long half-life. Once Rapamune maintenance dose is adjusted, patients should continue on the new maintenance dose for at least 7 to 14 days before further dosage adjustment with concentration monitoring. In most patients, dose adjustments can be based on simple proportion: new Rapamune dose = current dose x (target concentration/current concentration). A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to increase sirolimus trough concentrations: Rapamune loading dose = 3 x (new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose). The maximum Rapamune dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg. If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose, the loading dose should be administered over 2 days. Sirolimus trough concentrations should be monitored at least 3 to 4 days after a loading dose(s). Two milligrams (2 mg) of Rapamune Oral Solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg Rapamune Tablets; hence, are interchangeable on a mg-to-mg basis. However, it is not known if higher doses of Rapamune Oral Solution are clinically equivalent to higher doses of Rapamune Tablets on a mgtomg basis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Take once daily by mouth, consistently with or without food. Take the initial dose as soon as possible after transplantation and 4 hours after CsA ( 2 , 7.1 ). Adjust the Rapamune maintenance dose to achieve sirolimus trough concentrations within the target-range ( 2.3 ). Patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk Rapamune and Cyclosporine Combination Therapy: One loading dose of 6 mg on day 1, followed by daily maintenance doses of 2 mg ( 2.1 ). Rapamune Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal: 2-4 months post-transplantation, withdraw CsA over 4-8 weeks ( 2.2 ). Patients at high-immunologic risk Rapamune and Cyclosporine Combination Therapy (for the first 12 months post-transplantation): One loading dose of up to 15 mg on day 1, followed by daily maintenance doses of 5 mg ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Patients at Low- to Moderate-Immunologic Risk Rapamune and Cyclosporine Combination Therapy For de novo renal transplant patients, it is recommended that Rapamune Oral Solution and Tablets be used initially in a regimen with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. A loading dose of Rapamune equivalent to 3 times the maintenance dose should be given, i.e. a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg should be preceded with a loading dose of 6 mg. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to maintain sirolimus drug concentrations within the target-range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Rapamune Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal At 2 to 4 months following transplantation, cyclosporine should be progressively discontinued over 4 to 8 weeks, and the Rapamune dose should be adjusted to obtain sirolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the target-range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because cyclosporine inhibits the metabolism and transport of sirolimus, sirolimus concentrations may decrease when cyclosporine is discontinued, unless the Rapamune dose is increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Patients at High-Immunologic Risk In patients with high-immunologic risk, it is recommended that Rapamune be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first 12 months following transplantation [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety and efficacy of this combination in high-immunologic risk patients has not been studied beyond the first 12 months. Therefore, after the first 12 months following transplantation, any adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered on the basis of the clinical status of the patient. For patients receiving Rapamune with cyclosporine, Rapamune therapy should be initiated with a loading dose of up to 15 mg on day 1 post-transplantation. Beginning on day 2, an initial maintenance dose of 5 mg/day should be given. A trough level should be obtained between days 5 and 7, and the daily dose of Rapamune should thereafter be adjusted [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The starting dose of cyclosporine should be up to 7 mg/kg/day in divided doses and the dose should subsequently be adjusted to achieve target whole blood trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Prednisone should be administered at a minimum of 5mg/day. Antibody induction therapy may be used. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Monitoring of sirolimus trough concentrations is recommended for all patients, especially in those patients likely to have altered drug metabolism, in patients 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg, in patients with hepatic impairment,when a change in the Rapamune dosage form is made, and during concurrent administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting Rapamune therapy. Careful attention should be made to clinical signs/symptoms, tissue biopsy findings, and laboratory parameters. When used in combination with cyclosporine, sirolimus trough concentrations should be maintained within the target-range [see Clinical Studies (14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Following cyclosporine withdrawal in transplant patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, the target sirolimus trough concentrations should be 16 to 24 ng/mL for the first year following transplantation. Thereafter, the target sirolimus concentrations should be 12 to 20 ng/mL. The above recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. On average, chromatographic methods (HPLC UV or LC/MS/MS) yield results that are approximately 20% lower than the immunoassay for whole blood concentration determinations. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured sirolimus whole blood concentrations depend on the type of assay used, the concentrations obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay utilized to determine sirolimus trough concentrations. A discussion of different assay methods is contained in Clinical Therapeutics, Volume 22, Supplement B, April 2000 [see References (15)]. 2.4 Patients with Low Body Weight The initial dosage in patients 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg should be adjusted, based on body surface area, to 1 mg/m2/day. The loading dose should be 3 mg/m2. 2.5 Patients with Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the maintenance dose of Rapamune be reduced by approximately one third in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and by approximately one half in patients with severe hepatic impairment. It is not necessary to modify the Rapamune loading dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is not needed in patients with impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 2.7 Instructions for Dilution and Administration of Rapamune Oral Solution The amber oral dose syringe should be used to withdraw the prescribed amount of Rapamune Oral Solution from the bottle. Empty the correct amount of Rapamune from the syringe into only a glass or plastic container holding at least two (2) ounces (1/4 cup, 60 mL) of water or orange juice. No other liquids, including grapefruit juice, should be used for dilution [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Stir vigorously and drink at once. Refill the container with an additional volume [minimum of four (4) ounces (1/2 cup, 120 mL)] of water or orange juice, stir vigorously, and drink at once. Rapamune Oral Solution contains polysorbate 80, which is known to increase the rate of di(2ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This should be considered during the preparation and administration of Rapamune Oral Solution. It is important that these recommendations be followed closely.","activeIngredient":3074809},{"uuid":"0574-4160","administrationRoute":"OPHTHALMIC","dosageForm":"OINTMENT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Dexamethasone","proprietaryName":"Paddock Laboratories, LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE: For steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or risk of bacterial ocular infection exists.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 mg to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Neuro-Psychiatric ). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 mg to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 mg to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Cortisone, 25 mg Triamcinolone, 4 mg Hydrocortisone, 20 mg Paramethasone, 2 mg Prednisolone, 5 mg Betamethasone, 0.75 mg Prednisone, 5 mg Dexamethasone, 0.75 mg Methylprednisolone, 4 mg These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, 4 mg per mL First Day 1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly Dexamethasone tablets, 0.75 mg Second Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Third Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Fourth Day 2 tablets in two divided doses Fifth Day 1 tablet Sixth Day 1 tablet Seventh Day No treatment Eighth Day Follow-up visit This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases. In cerebral edema, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For palliative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective. Dexamethasone Suppression Tests Tests for Cushings syndrome Give 1 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. Test to distinguish Cushings syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushings syndrome due to other causes. Give 2 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. Proper Use of an Intensol An Intensol is a concentrated oral solution as compared to standard oral liquid medications. It is recommended that an Intensol be mixed with liquid or semi-solid food such as water, juices, soda or soda-like beverages, applesauce and puddings. Use only the calibrated dropper provided with this product. Draw into the dropper the amount prescribed for a single dose. Then squeeze the dropper contents into a liquid or semi-solid food. Stir the liquid or food gently for a few seconds. The Intensol formulation blends quickly and completely. The entire amount of the mixture, of drug and liquid or drug and food, should be consumed immediately. Do not store for future use.","activeIngredient":3070373},{"uuid":"0065-8533","administrationRoute":"AURICULAR (OTIC)","dosageForm":"SUSPENSION/ DROPS","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"CIPRODEX","proprietaryName":"Alcon Laboratories, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONSAND USAGE CIPRODEX is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below: Acute Otitis Media in pediatric patients (age 6 months and older) with tympanostomy tubes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 mg to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Neuro-Psychiatric ). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 mg to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 mg to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Cortisone, 25 mg Triamcinolone, 4 mg Hydrocortisone, 20 mg Paramethasone, 2 mg Prednisolone, 5 mg Betamethasone, 0.75 mg Prednisone, 5 mg Dexamethasone, 0.75 mg Methylprednisolone, 4 mg These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, 4 mg per mL First Day 1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly Dexamethasone tablets, 0.75 mg Second Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Third Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Fourth Day 2 tablets in two divided doses Fifth Day 1 tablet Sixth Day 1 tablet Seventh Day No treatment Eighth Day Follow-up visit This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases. In cerebral edema, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For palliative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective. Dexamethasone Suppression Tests Tests for Cushings syndrome Give 1 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. Test to distinguish Cushings syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushings syndrome due to other causes. Give 2 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. Proper Use of an Intensol An Intensol is a concentrated oral solution as compared to standard oral liquid medications. It is recommended that an Intensol be mixed with liquid or semi-solid food such as water, juices, soda or soda-like beverages, applesauce and puddings. Use only the calibrated dropper provided with this product. Draw into the dropper the amount prescribed for a single dose. Then squeeze the dropper contents into a liquid or semi-solid food. Stir the liquid or food gently for a few seconds. The Intensol formulation blends quickly and completely. The entire amount of the mixture, of drug and liquid or drug and food, should be consumed immediately. Do not store for future use.","activeIngredient":3070367},{"uuid":"26637-941","administrationRoute":"OPHTHALMIC","dosageForm":"OINTMENT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Dexamethasone","proprietaryName":"Putney, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE: For steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or risk of bacterial ocular infection exists.

Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant isolates. Streptococci, including some Group A and other beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris isolates, Haemophilus influenzae, H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species.

If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. (5.1). Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur. ( 5.2 ) Cataracts- Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.3 ) Delayed healing- The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.4 ) Bacterial infections- Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.5 ) Viral infections- Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).

Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole Capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS,and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experiencefor more information.) Description of Clinical Studies Blastomycosis Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \"single-patient-use\" protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total;110 given Itraconazole Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success(mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given Itraconazole Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without Itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure Itraconazole Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF.

Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients.)

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of adults (18 years of age) with mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed in this section. Culture and susceptibility testing Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin tablets, USP [see Microbiology(12.4)]. Therapy with levofloxacin tablets, USP may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected. As with other drugs in this class, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with levofloxacin tablets, USP. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance. 1.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to methicillinsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Adjunctive therapy should be used as clinically indicated. Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a documented or presumptive pathogen, combination therapy with an antipseudomonal -lactam is recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7-14 day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. MDRSP isolates are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC 2 mcg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins, e.g., cefuroxime, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 1.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 5-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (excluding multi-drug-resistant strains [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 1.4 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: 5-day and 10-14 day Treatment Regimens Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 1.5 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. 1.6 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Proteus mirabilis [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 1.7 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (mild to moderate) including abscesses, cellulitis, furuncles, impetigo, pyoderma, wound infections, due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. 1.8 Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 1.9 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 5-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. 1.10 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 10-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [see Clinical Studies (14.8)]. 1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: 5 or 10-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies(14.7, 14.8)].]. 1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 1.13 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure) Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis. The effectiveness of levofloxacin tablets, USP are based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin tablets, USP has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin tablets, USP in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets, USP therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Dosage and Administration(2.1, 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. 1.14 Plague Levofloxacin tablets, USP are indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older. Efficacy studies of levofloxacin tablets, USP could not be conducted in humans with plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals [seeDosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.10)].","warning":"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Levofloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 ); Patient Counseling Information ( 17.3 )] 5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid levofloxacin in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. These reactions often occur following the first dose. Some reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, hypotension/shock, seizure, loss of consciousness, tingling, angioedema (including tongue, laryngeal, throat, or facial edema/swelling), airway obstruction (including bronchospasm, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress), dyspnea, urticaria, itching, and other serious skin reactions. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness; allergic pneumonitis; interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure; hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure; anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities. The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing reports of severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) have been received for patients treated with levofloxacin. No evidence of serious drug-associated hepatotoxicity was detected in clinical trials of over 7,000 patients. Severe hepatotoxicity generally occurred within 14 days of initiation of therapy and most cases occurred within 6 days. Most cases of severe hepatotoxicity were not associated with hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The majority of fatal hepatotoxicity reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with hypersensitivity. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Convulsions, toxic psychoses, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin.Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system stimulation which may lead to tremors, restlessness, anxiety, lightheadedness, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, nightmares, insomnia, and, rarely, suicidal thoughts or acts. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving levofloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with other fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorder that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction.) [see Adverse Reactions (6); Drug Interactions (7.4, 7.5); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.7 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including levofloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of levofloxacin and may be irreversible. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation [see Adverse Reactions (6), Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.9 Prolongation of the QT Interval Some fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Rare cases of torsade de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Levofloxacin should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, and patients receiving ClassIA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval [see Adverse Reactions (6.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.10 Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals Levofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients ( 6 months of age and older) only for the prevention of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure)and for plague [see Indications and Usage (1.13, 1.14)]. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, and gait abnormality) compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients receiving levofloxacin [seeUse in Specific Populations (8.4 )]. In immature rats and dogs, the oral and intravenous administration of levofloxacin resulted in increased osteochondrosis. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of immature dogs dosed with levofloxacin revealed persistent lesions of the cartilage. Other fluroquinolones also produce similar erosions in the weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species [see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]. 5.11 Blood Glucose Disturbances As with other fluoroquinolones, disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyper- and hypoglycemia, have been reported with levofloxacin, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with levofloxacin, levofloxacin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2); Drug Interactions (7.3); Patient Counseling Information (17.4)] 5.12 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g., burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, \"V\" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if photosensitivity/phototoxicity occurs [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.13 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing levofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].","contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION Levofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, or other quinolone antibacterials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","howSupplied":"HOW SUPPLIED SECTION 16.1 Levofloxacin Tablets, USP Levofloxacin tablets, USP are supplied as 250, 500 and 750 mg capsule-shaped, coated tablets.

Therefore, adequate hydration of patients receiving levofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to levofloxacin in 7537 patients in 29 pooled Phase 3 clinical trials. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 74% of the population was < 65 years of age), 50% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 19% were Black. Patients were treated with levofloxacin for a wide variety of infectious diseases [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients received levofloxacin doses of 750 mg once daily, 250 mg once daily, or 500 mg once or twice daily. Treatment duration was usually 314 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 10 days. The overall incidence, type and distribution of adverse reactions was similar in patients receiving levofloxacin doses of 750 mg once daily, 250 mg once daily, and 500 mg once or twice daily. Discontinuation of levofloxacin due to adverse drug reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients overall, 3.8% of patients treated with the 250 mg and 500 mg doses and 5.4% of patients treated with the 750 mg dose. The most common adverse drug reactions leading to discontinuation with the 250 and 500 mg doses were gastrointestinal (1.4%), primarily nausea (0.6%); vomiting (0.4%); dizziness (0.3%); and headache (0.2%). The most common adverse drug reactions leading to discontinuation with the 750 mg dose were gastrointestinal (1.2%), primarily nausea (0.6%), vomiting (0.5%); dizziness (0.3%); and headache (0.3%). Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of levofloxacin -treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to <1% of levofloxacin -treated patients, are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (3%) are nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness. * N=7274 N=3758 (women) In clinical trials using multiple-dose therapy, ophthalmologic abnormalities, including cataracts and multiple punctate lenticular opacities, have been noted in patients undergoing treatment with quinolones, including levofloxacin. The relationship of the drugs to these events is not presently established. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Table 6 lists adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of levofloxacin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.","drugClass":"levofloxacin","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION 2.1 Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function The usual dose of Levofloxacin Tablet is 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg administered orally every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1. These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance Due to the designated pathogens [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Sequential therapy (intravenous to oral) may be instituted at the discretion of the physician. Due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae [see Indications and Usage (1.2)]. Due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (excluding multi-drug-resistant strains [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae,Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae [see Indications and Usage (1.3)].

Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis. This indication is based on a surrogate endpoint. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations achieved in humans are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety of levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations beyond 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9)] Prolonged levofloxacin therapy in adults should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis</em>. Higher doses of levofloxacin typically used for treatment of pneumonia can be used for treatment of plague, if clinically indicated. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients The dosage in pediatric patients 6 months of age is described below in Table 2. Due to Bacillus anthracis [see Indications and Usage (1.13)] and Yersinia pestis [see Indications and Usage (1.14)]. Sequential therapy (intravenous to oral) may be instituted at the discretion of the physician.

An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9).] Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk. Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Adults With Renal Impairment Administer levofloxacin with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced. No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance 50 mL/min. In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. 2.4 Drug Interaction With Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins Levofloxacin Tablets Levofloxacin Tablets should be administered at least two hours before or two hours after antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)] . 2.5 Administration Instructions Food and Levofloxacin Tablets Levofloxacin Tablets can be administered without regard to food.

In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur.

BYETTA should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. The concurrent use of BYETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be recommended. Based on postmarketing data BYETTA has been associated with acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. BYETTA has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using BYETTA. Other antidiabetic therapies should be considered in patients with a history of pancreatitis.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: Postmarketing reports with exenatide, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue BYETTA promptly. BYETTA should not be restarted. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis (5.1). Hypoglycemia: Increased risk when BYETTA is used in combination with medications known to cause hypoglycemia (e.g. insulin or insulin secretagogue). Consider reducing the dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue (5.2). Renal Impairment: Postmarketing reports with exenatide, sometimes requiring hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. BYETTA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation. Caution should be applied when initiating BYETTA or escalating the dose of BYETTA in patients with moderate renal failure (5.3, 8.6, 12.3) Severe Gastrointestinal Disease: Use of BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease (e.g., gastroparesis) (5.4). Hypersensitivity: Postmarketing reports with exenatide of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis and angioedema). The patient should discontinue BYETTA and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice (5.6). Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with BYETTA or any other antidiabetic drug (5.7). 5.1 Acute Pancreatitis Based on postmarketing data BYETTA has been associated with acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. After initiation of BYETTA, and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, BYETTA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, BYETTA should not be restarted. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than BYETTA in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 5.2 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYETTA is used in combination with a sulfonylurea. Therefore, patients receiving BYETTA and a sulfonylurea may require a lower dose of the sulfonylurea to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. When BYETTA is used in combination with insulin, the dose of insulin should be evaluated. In patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia consider reducing the dose of insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The concurrent use of BYETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be recommended. It is also possible that the use of BYETTA with other glucose-independent insulin secretagogues (e.g. meglitinides) could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. For additional information on glucose dependent effects see Mechanism of Action (12.1) . 5.3 Renal Impairment BYETTA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of BYETTA 5 mcg were not well-tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects. Because BYETTA may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia, treatment may worsen renal function. Caution should be applied when initiating or escalating doses of BYETTA from 5 mcg to 10 mcg in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min). There have been postmarketing reports of altered renal function, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Some of these events occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal function or hydration status, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or diuretics. Some events occurred in patients who had been experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, with or without dehydration. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including BYETTA. Exenatide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Disease BYETTA has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including gastroparesis. Because BYETTA is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, the use of BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease. 5.5 Immunogenicity Patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with BYETTA. Antibody levels were measured in 90% of subjects in the 30-week, 24-week and 16-week studies of BYETTA. In 3%, 4% and 1% of these patients, respectively, antibody formation was associated with an attenuated glycemic response. If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control, alternative antidiabetic therapy should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis and angioedema) in patients treated with BYETTA. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue BYETTA and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with BYETTA or any other antidiabetic drug.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of severe hypersensitivity to exenatide or any product components (4.1). 4.1 Hypersensitivity BYETTA is contraindicated in patients with prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to exenatide or to any of the product components.","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied BYETTA is supplied as a sterile solution for subcutaneous injection containing 250 mcg/mL exenatide.

In the 30-week controlled trials of BYETTA add-on to metformin and/or sulfonylurea, antibodies were assessed at 2- to 6-week intervals. The mean antibody titer peaked at week 6 and was reduced by 55% by week 30. Three hundred and sixty patients (38%) had low titer antibodies (<625) to exenatide at 30 weeks. The level of glycemic control (HbA1c) in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 534 patients (56%) without antibody titers. An additional 59 patients (6%) had higher titer antibodies (625) at 30 weeks. Of these patients, 32 (3% overall) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA; the remaining 27 (3% overall) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. In the 16-week trial of BYETTA add-on to thiazolidinediones, with or without metformin, 36 patients (31%) had low titer antibodies to exenatide at 16 weeks. The level of glycemic control in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 69 patients (60%) without antibody titer. An additional 10 patients (9%) had higher titer antibodies at 16 weeks. Of these patients, 4 (4% overall) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA; the remaining 6 (5% overall) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. In the 24-week trial of BYETTA used as monotherapy, 40 patients (28%) had low titer antibodies to exenatide at 24 weeks. The level of glycemic control in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 101 patients (70%) without antibody titers. An additional 3 patients (2%) had higher titer antibodies at 24 weeks. Of these patients, 1 (1% overall) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA; the remaining 2 (1% overall) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Antibodies to exenatide were not assessed in the 30-week trial of BYETTA used in combination with insulin glargine. Two hundred and ten patients with antibodies to exenatide in the BYETTA clinical trials were tested for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to GLP-1 and/or glucagon. No treatment-emergent cross reactive antibodies were observed across the range of titers.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergy/Hypersensitivity: injection-site reactions, generalized pruritus and/or urticaria, macular or papular rash, angioedema, anaphylactic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Drug Interactions: International normalized ratio (INR) increased with concomitant warfarin use sometimes associated with bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea resulting in dehydration; abdominal distension, abdominal pain, eructation, constipation, flatulence, acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death [see Limitations of Use (1.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Neurologic: dysgeusia; somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: altered renal function, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure or acute renal failure (sometimes requiring hemodialysis), kidney transplant and kidney transplant dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: alopecia","drugClass":"exenatide","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Inject subcutaneously within 60 minutes prior to morning and evening meals (or before the two main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or more apart) (2.1).

(5.1) Falling asleep during activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, and somnolence may occur. (5.2) Hallucinations/psychosis and dyskinesia may occur. (5.3, 5.9) Symptomatic postural hypotension and syncope may occur, especially during dose escalation. (5.4, 5.5) Consider dose reduction or stopping NEUPRO if patient develops compulsive behaviors. (5.6) Elevation of blood pressure and heart rate may occur. (5.7) Application site reactions can occur and may be severe. (5.10) Hyperpyrexia and confusion may occur with sudden discontinuation or dose reduction. (5.15) 5.1 Sulfite Sensitivity NEUPRO contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.2 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and with Restless Legs Syndrome treated with NEUPRO have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on NEUPRO, some did not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported as late as one year after initiation of treatment. In clinical trials in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, 2% of patients treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose (3 mg/24 hours) reported sleep attacks compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, there was an increased risk of somnolence for early-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 19%, placebo 3%), for advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 32%, placebo 28%), and for Restless Legs Syndrome (NEUPRO 10%, placebo 4%). Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving, operating machines, or working at heights during treatment with NEUPRO. Patients who have already experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities while taking NEUPRO. Before initiating treatment with NEUPRO, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase this risk with NEUPRO such as concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), NEUPRO should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If a decision is made to continue NEUPRO, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish whether dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.3 Hallucinations/Psychosis There was an increased risk for hallucinations in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of hallucinations was 7% for NEUPRO and 3% for placebo, and this treatment difference increased with increasing dose. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment (mainly during the dose escalation/titration period) in 3% of advanced-stage Parkinson's disease patients treated with the maximum recommended dose of NEUPRO compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients. Hallucinations have also been reported in post-marketing reports. Post-marketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic behavior during NEUPRO treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of NEUPRO. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may consist of one or more of the following: paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. These various manifestations of psychotic behavior were also observed during the clinical development of NEUPRO for early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with NEUPRO because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of NEUPRO [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Symptomatic Hypotension Dopaminergic agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk. An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for NEUPRO and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for NEUPRO and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (NEUPRO incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing position. Patients experienced dose-related decreases in blood pressure at different times throughout the trial including the final visit. An analysis using a variety of adverse reaction terms suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, including dizziness/postural dizziness and others, showed an increased risk for all patients treated with NEUPRO. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of hypotension/orthostatic hypotension was 29% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in early-stage Parkinson's disease, 27% for NEUPRO and 23% for placebo in advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 8% for NEUPRO and 7% for placebo in Restless Legs Syndrome. This increased risk for symptomatic hypotension and decreases in blood pressure was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this study. The increased risk for significant decreases in blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension occurred especially in the dose escalation/titration period. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported in patients using dopamine agonists, and for this reason patients should be alerted to the possibility of syncope. Because the studies of NEUPRO excluded patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms of syncope and pre-syncope. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Patients may experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including NEUPRO, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with NEUPRO. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking NEUPRO. 5.7 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Some patients treated with NEUPRO exhibited increases in systolic blood pressure (greater than 180 mm Hg) and/or diastolic blood pressure (greater than 105 mm Hg) while supine or standing. In patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, this increased risk for systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg was 5% for NEUPRO and 3% for placebo and for diastolic blood pressure greater than 105 mm Hg was 4% for NEUPRO and 0% for placebo. In patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, this increased risk for diastolic blood pressure greater than 105 mm Hg was 8% for NEUPRO and 4% for placebo. Increases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or more) and in diastolic blood pressure (at least 10 mm Hg or more) occurred more frequently (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) in all patients (i.e., early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome) taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose. These increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position. More severe increases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or more) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or more) also occurred more frequently (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in NEUPRO-treated patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and with Restless Legs Syndrome during measurements when supine, standing, and/or changing from supine to standing position. In the placebo-controlled trials, there was an increased risk for hypertension as an adverse reaction with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 3% vs. placebo 0%) and Restless Legs Syndrome (NEUPRO 4% vs. placebo 0%). Some patients treated with NEUPRO exhibited increased pulse (greater than 100 beats per minute) while supine and/or standing. In patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, there was an increased risk (at least 2% greater than placebo) of increased pulse for patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose. In patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, there was an increased risk (at least 5% greater than placebo) of increased pulse for patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose. These findings of blood pressure and heart rate elevations should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.8 Weight Gain and Fluid Retention Patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose for early-stage Parkinson's disease had a higher incidence (2%) of substantial weight gain (more than 10% of baseline weight) than patients taking placebo (0%). In advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, the incidence of weight gain more than 10% of baseline weight was 9% in NEUPRO-treated patients (for the maximum recommended dose) and 1% in placebo-treated patients. This weight gain was frequently associated with the development of peripheral edema in patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting that NEUPRO may cause fluid retention in some Parkinson's patients. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of peripheral edema was 3% for NEUPRO and 2% for placebo in early-stage Parkinson's disease and 9% for NEUPRO and 1% for placebo in advanced-stage Parkinson's disease. These treatment differences increased further with treatment at NEUPRO dosing above the maximum recommended doses. Monitor for weight gain and fluid retention when treating patients with concomitant illnesses such as congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency. 5.9 Dyskinesia NEUPRO may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of dyskinesia was increased for NEUPRO (NEUPRO 14% vs. placebo 7%) in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and this incidence increased with increasing dose. Patients treated with the maximum recommended dose of NEUPRO also had an increased risk (NEUPRO 3% vs. placebo 0%) for early discontinuation from the study because of dyskinesia. 5.10 Application Site Reactions Application site reactions (ASRs) occurred at a greater frequency in the NEUPRO-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies with NEUPRO. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of application site reactions was 32% for NEUPRO and 19% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 36% for NEUPRO and 13% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 43% for NEUPRO and 4% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. ASRs exhibited a dose-dependent relationship for all doses for patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. ASRs were also of sufficient severity to cause study discontinuation for patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 3% vs. placebo 0%), advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 2% vs. placebo 0%), and Restless Legs Syndrome (NEUPRO 12% vs. placebo 0%) who were treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose. The signs and symptoms of these reactions generally were localized erythema, edema, or pruritus limited to the patch area and usually did not lead to dose reduction. Generalized skin reactions (e.g., allergic rash, including erythematous, macular-papular rash, or pruritus) have been reported at lower rates than ASRs during the development of NEUPRO. In a clinical study designed to investigate the cumulative skin irritation of NEUPRO, daily rotation of NEUPRO application sites has been shown to reduce the incidence of ASRs in comparison to repetitive application to the same site. In a clinical study investigating the skin sensitizing potential of NEUPRO in 221 healthy subjects, no case of contact sensitization was observed. Localized sensitization reactions were observed in a study with healthy subjects by continuously rotating a 0.5 mg/24 hours transdermal system, after induction of maximal irritational stress was achieved by repetitive transdermal system application to the same site. If a patient reports a persistent application site reaction (of more than a few days), reports an increase in severity, or reports a skin reaction spreading outside the application site, an assessment of the risk and benefits for the individual patient should be conducted. If a generalized skin reaction associated with the use of NEUPRO is observed, NEUPRO should be discontinued. 5.11 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using NEUPRO for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.12 Augmentation and Rebound in RLS Augmentation is a worsening of RLS symptoms during treatment, leading to an increase in overall symptom severity or earlier time of symptom onset each day compared to before initiation of treatment. Use of dopaminergic medications, including NEUPRO, may result in augmentation. Rebound, an exacerbation of RLS symptoms, is considered to be an end of dose effect, related to the half-life of the therapeutic agent. Reports in the published literature indicate discontinuation or wearing off of dopaminergic medications can result in rebound. 5.13 Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Cardioversion The backing layer of NEUPRO contains aluminum. To avoid skin burns, NEUPRO should be removed prior to magnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion. 5.14 Heat Application The effect of application of heat to the transdermal system has not been studied. However, heat application has been shown to increase absorption several fold with other transdermal products. Patients should be advised to avoid exposing the NEUPRO application site to external sources of direct heat, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, heated water beds, and prolonged direct sunlight. 5.15 Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, rhabdomyolysis, and/or autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in anti-Parkinsonian therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of NEUPRO treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.16 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. 5.17 Binding to Melanin As has been reported with other dopamine agonists, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat and monkey was evident after a single dose of rotigotine, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS NEUPRO is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to rotigotine or the components of the transdermal system.

Adverse Reactions in Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease The safety of NEUPRO was evaluated in a total of 649 early-stage Parkinson's disease patients who participated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with durations of 3 to 9 months. Additional safety information was collected in short-term studies and two open-label extension studies in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% greater than placebo) for the maximum recommended dose of NEUPRO (6 mg/24 hours) were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, application site reactions, dizziness, anorexia, disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, hyperhidrosis, and visual disturbance. In this trial, 12% of patients treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose (6 mg/24 hours) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions, compared with 6% of patients who received placebo. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 2% of NEUPRO-treated patients and more frequent than in placebo-treated patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. Incidences for the non-recommended 8 mg/24 hours dose are also shown.

During the titration phase, this increased incidence of a treatment difference was observed for nausea, somnolence, vomiting, application site reactions (ASRs), dizziness, sweating increased, anorexia, and visual disturbance. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for nausea and ASRs. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (at least 7 days) into the maintenance phase. These \"persistent\" adverse reactions included ASRs, anorexia, somnolence, and nausea. Adverse Reactions in Advanced-Stage Parkinson's Disease The safety evaluation of NEUPRO was based on a total of 672 NEUPRO-treated patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who participated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (two fixed-dose trials and one flexible-dose trial) with durations of 3 to 7 months. Patients received concomitant levodopa in these studies. Additional safety information was collected in earlier short-term studies and two open-label extension studies in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease. In the dose-response, placebo-controlled trial for advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% greater than placebo) for the maximum recommended dose of NEUPRO (8 mg/24 hours) were application site reactions, nausea, peripheral edema, dizziness, and dyskinesia. In this trial, approximately 15% of patients treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose (8 mg/24 hours) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions, compared with 9% of patients who received placebo. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 2% of NEUPRO-treated patients and more frequent than in placebo-treated patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease. Incidences for the non-recommended 12 mg/24 hours dose are also shown.

During the titration phase, an increased incidence was observed for application site reactions (ASRs), nausea, hallucinations, constipation, dyskinesia, and dizziness. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for ASRs and peripheral edema. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (at least 7 days) into the maintenance phase. A notably \"persistent\" adverse reaction was ASRs. Adverse Reactions in Restless Legs Syndrome The safety evaluation of NEUPRO was based on 745 NEUPRO-treated patients with Restless Legs Syndrome who participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with maintenance durations of 6 months. Additional safety information was collected in earlier short-term studies and three open-label extension studies in patients with RLS. In the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials for RLS, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% greater than placebo) for the maximum recommended dose of NEUPRO (3 mg/24 hours) were application site reactions, nausea, disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, somnolence, and headache. In the two fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 24% of patients treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose (3 mg/24 hours) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions, compared with 3% of patients who received placebo. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of NEUPRO-treated patients and more frequent than in placebo-treated patients in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

During the titration phase, an increased incidence was observed for application site reactions (ASRs), nausea, headache, asthenic conditions, and disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for ASRs. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (at least 7 days) into the maintenance phase. These \"persistent\" adverse reactions were ASRs, nausea, and disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep. 6.2 Laboratory Changes Some clinical laboratory analytes were abnormal in patients treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose in the fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials for patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and with RLS. Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO had an increased risk for low hemoglobin below the normal reference range (NEUPRO 8% vs. placebo 2%) and for decreased hematocrit below the normal reference range (NEUPRO 8% vs. placebo 5%). Patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO had an increased risk for a low hemoglobin below the normal reference range (NEUPRO 15% vs. placebo 11%) and for decreased hematocrit below the normal reference range (NEUPRO 17% vs. placebo 14%). Patients with RLS receiving NEUPRO had an increased risk for a decreased hemoglobin below the normal reference range (NEUPRO 15% vs. placebo 12%). There was also an increased risk for markedly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit (NEUPRO 2% vs. placebo 0%) in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO and for markedly decreased hematocrit (NEUPRO 1% vs. placebo 0%) in patients with RLS receiving NEUPRO. Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO had an increased risk for elevated serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) above the normal reference range (NEUPRO 11% vs. placebo 2%). There was also an increased risk for markedly elevated serum BUN (NEUPRO 3% vs. placebo 2%) in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO. There was an increased risk for low serum glucose below the normal reference range in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO (NEUPRO 15% vs. placebo 6%) and in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 10% vs. placebo 7%). There was also an increased risk for markedly decreased serum glucose (NEUPRO 1% vs. placebo 0%) in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease receiving NEUPRO. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was elevated in Japanese patients taking NEUPRO for early- or advanced-stage Parkinson's disease in placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies conducted in Japan. The frequency of CPK elevation observed in patients receiving NEUPRO for early-stage Parkinson's disease was 40% (35/88) in the NEUPRO group compared to 17% (15/89) in the placebo group. The frequency of CPK elevation observed in patients receiving NEUPRO for advanced-stage Parkinson's disease was 39% (99/253) in the NEUPRO group compared to 20% (34/171) in the placebo group using pooled data from two studies. Increased CPK occurred at any time during the respective studies, and in some instances increased CPK was observed at two or more consecutive visits. The total daily dose of NEUPRO taken by patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease ranged between 2 mg/24 hours to 16 mg/24 hours. Studies of NEUPRO conducted outside of Japan did not include assessments of serum CPK in patients treated for Parkinson's disease.","drugClass":"rotigotine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Parkinson's disease: Initially, 2 mg/24 hours for early-stage disease or 4 mg/24 hours for advanced-stage disease. The dose may be increased as needed by 2 mg/24 hours at weekly intervals, up to 6 mg/24 hours for early-stage disease and up to 8 mg/24 hours for advanced-stage disease. (2.1) Restless Legs Syndrome: Initially, 1 mg/24 hours, increased as needed by 1 mg/24 hours at weekly intervals, up to 3 mg/24 hours. (2.2) Apply once a day to the skin; press firmly in place for 30 seconds. Do not place NEUPRO on oily, irritated, or damaged skin, or where it will be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not use the same site more than once every 14 days. The prescribed dose may be achieved using single or multiple patches. (2.3) To discontinue treatment, reduce the dose gradually until complete withdrawal of NEUPRO. (2.4) 2.1 Dosage in Parkinson's Disease Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease In patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the recommended starting dose for NEUPRO is 2 mg/24 hours. Based upon individual patient clinical response and tolerability, NEUPRO dosage may be increased weekly by 2 mg/24 hours if additional therapeutic effect is needed. The lowest effective dose is 4 mg/24 hours. The maximum recommended dose for early-stage Parkinson's disease is 6 mg/24 hours. Advanced-Stage Parkinson's Disease In patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, the recommended starting dose for NEUPRO is 4 mg/24 hours. Based upon individual patient clinical response and tolerability, NEUPRO dosage may be increased weekly by 2 mg/24 hours if additional therapeutic effect is needed. The maximum recommended dose for advanced-stage Parkinson's disease is 8 mg/24 hours. 2.2 Dosage in Restless Legs Syndrome In patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, the recommended starting dose for NEUPRO is 1 mg/24 hours. Based upon individual patient clinical response and tolerability, NEUPRO dosage may be increased weekly by 1 mg/24 hours if additional therapeutic effect is needed. The lowest effective dose is 1 mg/24 hours. The maximum recommended dose is 3 mg/24 hours. 2.3 Administration Information NEUPRO is applied once a day. The adhesive side of the transdermal system should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the front of the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, shoulder, or upper arm. The transdermal system should be applied at approximately the same time every day, at a convenient time for the patient. Because NEUPRO is administered transdermally, food is not expected to affect absorption and it can be applied irrespective of the timing of meals. The application site for NEUPRO should be moved on a daily basis (for example, from the right side to the left side and from the upper body to the lower body). NEUPRO should not be applied to the same application site more than once every 14 days and should not be placed on skin that is oily, irritated, or damaged, or where it will be rubbed by tight clothing. If it is necessary to apply NEUPRO to a hairy area, the area should be shaved at least 3 days prior to NEUPRO application. The system should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner. The system should be pressed firmly in place for 30 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially around the edges. If the patient forgets to replace NEUPRO, or if the transdermal system becomes dislodged, another transdermal system should be applied for the remainder of the day. The prescribed dose may be achieved using single or multiple patches [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 2.4 Discontinuation of NEUPRO For discontinuation of NEUPRO in patients with Parkinson's disease, reduce the daily dose by a maximum of 2 mg every 24 hours preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of NEUPRO is achieved. For discontinuation of NEUPRO in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, reduce the daily dose by 1 mg every 24 hours preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of NEUPRO is achieved.","activeIngredient":3084307},{"uuid":"76519-1063","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM","proprietaryName":"H.J Harkins Company Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"Indications $ Usage Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin calcium tablets can be started simultaneously with diet. 1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets is indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin calcium tablets is indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets is indicated to: Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF Reduce the risk of angina 1.2 Hyperlipidemia Atorvastatin calcium tablets is indicated: As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb); As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV); For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet; To reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable; As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: a.

A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing atorvastatin calcium tablets. Atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration,Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors (2.6), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations * Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary ( 12.3) Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir*, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions, Colchicine (7.11)]. Atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium tablets in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with atorvastatin calcium tablets, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart atorvastatin calcium tablets. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin calcium tablets [see Contraindications, Active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels (4.1)]. 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin calcium tablets. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin calcium tablets does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0-24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0-24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions, Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences (6.1)]. CLOSE","contraindication":"Contraindications 4.1 Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels - 4.2 Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication - 4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Atorvastatin calcium tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atorvastatin calcium tablets use during pregnancy; however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM TABLETS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy(8.1)]. 4.4 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk; however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require atorvastatin calcium tablets treatment should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3)].","howSupplied":"How Supplied torvastatin Calcium Tablets are supplied as white, round, film-coated tablets of atorvastatin calcium containing 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg atorvastatin. 40 mg tablets: debossed with \"40\" on one side and plain on the other.

In the atorvastatin calcium tablets placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 7311 placebo; age range 1093 years, 39% women, 91% Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin calcium tablets and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS [see Clinical Studies, Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (14.1)] involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32% women; 94.3% Caucasians, 2.4% South Asians, 2.3% Afro-Caribbean, 1.0% other) with type 2 diabetes treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=1,428) or placebo (n=1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT [see Clinical Studies, Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (14.1)] involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19% women; 94.1% Caucasians, 2.9% Blacks, 1.0% Asians, 2.0% other) with clinically evident CHD treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg daily (n=4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the high-dose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8%; 497, 9.9%, respectively) as compared to the low-dose group (69, 1.4%; 404, 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3 ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3%) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2%) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10 ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1%). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL [see Clinical Studies, Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (14.1)] involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19% women; 99.3% Caucasians, 0.4% Asians, 0.3% Blacks, 0.04% other) treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day (n=4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n=4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40% women; 93.3% Caucasians, 3.0% Blacks, 0.6% Asians, 3.1% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg (n=2365) or placebo (n=2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3 x ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1%) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions, Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA (5.5)]. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (218/2365, 9.2% vs. 274/2366, 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (55/2365, 2.3% vs. 33/2366, 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 2 (4%) placebo]. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%). The proportions of subjects who experienced non-cardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (5.0%) than in the placebo group (4.0%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of atorvastatin calcium tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and interstitial lung disease. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 10-17 years) In a 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n=140, 31% female; 92% Caucasians, 1.6% Blacks, 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo [see Clinical Studies, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4)].","drugClass":"atorvastatin","maximumDoseSchedule":"Dosage and Administration 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (FredricksonTypes IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12), and Indications and Usage, Hyperlipidemia (1.2)]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, SKELETAL MUSCLE (5.1), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin calcium tablets; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, SKELETAL MUSCLE (5.1), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PHARMACOKINETICS (12.3)]. 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin calcium tablets and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin calcium tablets is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin calcium tablets is employed [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, SKELETAL MUSCLE (5.1), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].","activeIngredient":3071976},{"uuid":"59762-6733","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Amlodipine besylate and Atorvastatin calcium","proprietaryName":"Greenstone LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets (amlodipine and atorvastatin) are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate. Amlodipine Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets is a combination of amlodipine besylate, a calcium channel blocker, and atorvastatin calcium, a HMG CoA-reductase inhibitor, indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate. Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure (1.1). Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of Coronary Artery Disease (1.2). Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet for prevention of cardiovascular disease (1.3) and hyperlipidemia (1.4). 1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%, amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure. Atorvastatin Therapy with HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (lipid-altering agents) should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease from hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet restriction. 1.3 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) Reduce the risk of stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures Reduce the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF) Reduce the risk of angina 1.4 Hyperlipidemia Atorvastatin is indicated: As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides (TG) levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV); For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet To reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: a.LDL-C remains 190 mg/dL or b.LDL-C remains 160 mg/dL and: there is a positive family history of premature CVD or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient 1.5 Limitations of Use Atorvastatin has not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V).","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Hepatic Transaminitis: Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment (5.2). Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, acute hypotension is unlikely (5.4). Angina or myocardial infarction may occur with initiation or dose increase (5.3). 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values > 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 2. Atorvastatin Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.13)]. Withhold or discontinue in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders; and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like atorvastatin, and some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials with atorvastatin developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets [see Contraindications (4.1)]. 5.3 Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. 5.4 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension is possible with use of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. 5.5 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Avoid a statin with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.6 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated with atorvastatin for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other statins. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.7 Hemorrhagic Stroke In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where atorvastatin 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Active liver disease (4.1) Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant (4.2) Nursing mothers (4.3) 4.1 Active Liver Disease Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 4.2 Pregnancy Atorvastatin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Atorvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy; however, in rare reports congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazard. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 4.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin or amlodipine are excreted into human milk; however, a small amount of another statin does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets contain amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium equivalent to amlodipine and atorvastatin in the dose strengths described below.

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1,092 patients in double-blind placebo-controlled studies treated for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse reactions have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets, no adverse reactions peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse reactions are similar in terms of nature, severity, and frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin. The following information is based on the clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin. Amlodipine Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N=1,730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1,250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are dizziness and edema.

Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. Atorvastatin In the atorvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8,755 atorvastatin vs. 7,311 placebo; age range 1093 years, 39% women, 91% Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued because of adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with atorvastatin in placebo-controlled trials (n=8,755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%). Table 3 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, reported in 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin (n=8,755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials.

Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19% women; 94.1% Caucasians, 2.9% Blacks, 1.0% Asians, 2.0% other) with clinically evident CHD treated with atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n=5,006) or atorvastatin 80 mg daily (n=4,995), serious adverse reactions and discontinuations because of adverse reactions increased with dose. Persistent transaminase elevations ( 3 ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3%) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2%) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10 ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1%). Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4,731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40% women; 93.3% Caucasians, 3.0% Blacks, 0.6% Asians, 3.1% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with atorvastatin 80 mg (n=2,365) or placebo (n=2,366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3 ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1%) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (218/2365, 9.2% vs. 274/2366, 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (55/2365, 2.3% vs. 33/2366, 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin vs. 2 (4%) placebo]. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the atorvastatin 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%). The proportions of subjects who experienced non-cardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin 80 mg group (5.0%) than in the placebo group (4.0%). Pediatrics: In a 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n=140, 31% female; 92% Caucasians, 1.6% Blacks, 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.11), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval of amlodipine and atorvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Amlodipine The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles. Atorvastatin Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and interstitial lung disease. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).","drugClass":"amlodipine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual starting dose (mg daily) Maximum dose (mg daily) Amlodipine 5Start small adults or children, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency on 2.5 mg once daily (2) 10 Atorvastatin 1020Start patients requiring large LDL-C reduction (> 45%) at 40 mg once daily (2) 80 Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets Dosage of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets or a dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina. Amlodipine The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina: The recommended dose of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 510 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect. Coronary Artery Disease: The recommended dose range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 510 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Pediatrics: The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 617 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Atorvastatin (Hyperlipidemia) Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb): The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines ). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage range of atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: Atorvastatin may be used with bile acid resins. Monitor for signs of myopathy in patients receiving the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with Renal Impairment: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use with Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors: In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), avoid therapy with atorvastatin. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, use the lowest necessary dose of atorvastatin. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, limit therapy with atorvastatin to 20 mg, and make appropriate clinical assessment to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, limit therapy with atorvastatin to 40 mg, and make appropriate clinical assessment to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7)]. Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age): The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines 1, References (15), Clinical Pharmacology (12), and Indications and Usage (1.4)]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.","activeIngredient":3115022},{"uuid":"60760-354","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM","proprietaryName":"St Marys Medical Park Pharmacy","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin calcium tablets can be started simultaneously with diet. Atorvastatin calcium tablets are an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to: Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors ( 1.1). Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors ( 1.1). Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD ( 1.1). Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia ( 1.2). Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( 1.2). Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) ( 1.2). Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy ( 1.2). Limitations of Use Atorvastatin calcium have not been studied in Fredrickson Types I and V dyslipidemias. 1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to: Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to: Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF Reduce the risk of angina 1.2 Hyperlipidemia Atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated: As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia ( Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb); As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels ( Fredrickson Type IV); For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet; To reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable; As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C remains 190 mg/dL or LDL-C remains 160 mg/dL and: there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient 1.3 Limitations of Use Atorvastatin calcium tablets have not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons ( Fredrickson Types I and V).","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age (> 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Atorvastatin calcium therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected ( 5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter ( 5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the atorvastatin calcium 80 mg group vs. placebo ( 5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing atorvastatin. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs ( see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [ see also Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations *Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3) Cyclosporine HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir*, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.11) ]. Atorvastatin therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with atorvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart atorvastatin. Atorvastatin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0 to 24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0 to 24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where atorvastatin calcium 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin calcium 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels ( 4.1).

Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication ( 4.2) 4.1 Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels 4.2 Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication 4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Atorvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy; however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. ATORVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk; however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require atorvastatin treatment should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ].","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Atorvastatin calcium tablets are supplied as white, oval, biconvex film-coated tablets of atorvastatin calcium containing 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. 10 mg tablets: Atorvastatin calcium tablets, 10 mg, are available for oral administration as white, oval, biconvex film-coated tablets, engraved APO on one side, A10 on the other side.

The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%). Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, reported in 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium (n=8755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials.

Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 10,305 participants (age range 40 to 80 years, 19% women; 94.6% Caucasians, 2.6% Africans, 1.5% South Asians, 1.3% mixed/other) treated with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (n=5,168) or placebo (n=5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with atorvastatin calcium was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of follow-up. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 2,838 subjects (age range 39 to 77 years, 32% women; 94.3% Caucasians, 2.4% South Asians, 2.3% Afro-Caribbean, 1.0% other) with type 2 diabetes treated with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (n=1,428) or placebo (n=1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 10,001 subjects (age range 29 to 78 years, 19% women; 94.1% Caucasians, 2.9% Blacks, 1.0% Asians, 2.0% other) with clinically evident CHD treated with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium 80 mg daily (n=4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the high-dose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8%; 497, 9.9%, respectively) as compared to the low-dose group (69, 1.4%; 404, 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) occurred in 62 (1.3%) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2%) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10 x ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1%). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 8,888 subjects (age range 26 to 80 years, 19% women; 99.3% Caucasians, 0.4% Asians, 0.3% Blacks, 0.04% other) treated with atorvastatin calcium 80 mg/day (n=4439) or simvastatin 20 to 40 mg daily (n=4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 21 to 92 years, 40% women; 93.3% Caucasians, 3.0% Blacks, 0.6% Asians, 3.1% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with atorvastatin calcium 80 mg (n=2365) or placebo (n=2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1%) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (218/2365, 9.2% vs. 274/2366, 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (55/2365, 2.3% vs. 33/2366, 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin calcium vs. 2 (4%) placebo]. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the atorvastatin calcium 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%). The proportions of subjects who experienced non-cardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin calcium 80 mg group (5.0%) than in the placebo group (4.0%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of atorvastatin calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness,depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 10 to 17 years) In a 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n=140, 31% female; 92% Caucasians, 1.6% Blacks, 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) ].","drugClass":"atorvastatin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range: 10 to 80 mg once daily ( 2.1). Recommended start dose: 10 or 20 mg once daily ( 2.1). Patients requiring large LDL-C reduction (>45%) may start at 40 mg once daily ( 2.1). Pediatric starting dose: 10 mg once daily; maximum recommended dose: 20 mg once daily ( 2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia ( Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age) The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) ]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ]. 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with atorvastatin should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed [see Warnings and Precautions , Skeletal Muscle (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) ].","activeIngredient":3097661},{"uuid":"59088-704","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Leximenth","proprietaryName":"PureTek Corporation","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"Uses for the temporary relief of minor pain, itching and irritation due to / associated with simple backache arthritis sprains muscle strains bruises minor cuts/scrapes minor burns/sunburn insect bites","warning":"5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke can occur with NSAID treatment. Use the lowest effective dose of diclofenac sodium topical solution in patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. (5.1) NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation. Prescribe diclofenac sodium topical solution with caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. (5.2) Elevation of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with NSAIDs. Discontinue diclofenac sodium topical solution immediately if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen. (5.3) Hypertension can occur with NSAID treatment. Monitor blood pressure closely with diclofenac sodium topical solution treatment. (5.4) Use diclofenac sodium topical solution with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure. (5.5) Long-term administration of NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Use diclofenac sodium topical solution with caution in patients at greatest risk of this reaction, including the elderly, those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, and those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors. (5.6) Anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients with the aspirin triad or in patients without prior exposure to diclofenac sodium topical solution. (5.7) NSAIDs can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. (5.8) Not for use during pregnancy. (5.9) Do not administer to patients with aspirin sensitive asthma and use with caution in patients with preexisting asthma. (5.10) Avoid exposure of treated knee(s) to natural or artificial sunlight. (5.11) Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium topical solution with eyes and mucosa. (5.12) Avoid concurrent use with oral NSAIDs. (5.13) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several oral COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution and COX-2 selective and nonselective orally administered NSAIDs, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. Two large, controlled, clinical trials of an orally administered COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see Contraindications (4)]. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and NSAIDS, such as diclofenac, does increase the risk of serious GI events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 5.2 Gastrointestinal Effects Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Prescribe NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution, with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, use special care when treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during diclofencac therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. For high-risk patients, consider alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Borderline elevations (less than 3 times the upper limit of the normal [ULN] range) or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% of oral diclofenac-treated patients in clinical trials of indications other than acute pain. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) is recommended for the monitoring of liver injury. In clinical trials of an oral diclofenac misoprostol combination product, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In an open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients with oral diclofenac were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the 3,700 patients and included marked elevations (>8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In this open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (>8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal test occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with oral diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of NSAID therapy. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of sever hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of oral diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Measure transaminases (ALT and AST) periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, monitor transaminases within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium topical solution immediately. To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flulike\" symptoms), and the appropriate action to take if these signs and symptoms appear. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical solution, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium topical solution with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, certain antibiotics, antiepileptics). Caution patients to avoid taking unprescribed acetaminophen while using diclofenac sodium topical solution. 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Use NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution, with caution in patients with hypertension. Monitor blood pressure (BP) closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Patients taking ACE-inhibitors, thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 5.5 Congestive Heart Failure and Edema Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution. Use diclofenac sodium topical solution with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure. 5.6 Renal Effects Use caution when initiating treatment with diclofenac sodium topical solution in patients with considerable dehydration. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium topical solution in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium topical solution is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac sodium topical solution therapy is initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable. 5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to diclofenac sodium topical solution. Do not prescribe diclofenac sodium topical solution to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Seek emergency help in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. 5.8 Skin Reactions Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to open skin wounds, infections, inflammations, or exfoliative dermatitis, as it may affect absorption and tolerability of the drug. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations, and discontinue use of the drug at the first appearance of skin rash or any other signs of hypersensitivity. 5.9 Pregnancy Diclofenac sodium topical solution should not be used by pregnant or nursing women or those intending to become pregnant. 5.10 Preexisting Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, do not administer diclofenac sodium topical solution to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and use with caution in patients with preexisting asthma. 5.11 Sun Exposure Instruct patients to avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight on treated knee(s) because studies in animals indicated topical diclofenac treatment resulted in an earlier onset of ultraviolet light-induced skin tumors. The potential effects of diclofenac sodium topical solution on skin response to ultraviolet damage in humans are not known. 5.12 Eye Exposure Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium topical solution with eyes and mucosa. Advise patients that if eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour. 5.13 Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs with diclofenac sodium topical solution resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage, more frequent abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Therefore, do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium topical solution and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations. 5.14 Corticosteroid Treatment Diclofenac sodium topical solution cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-response illness. For patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy, taper slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. 5.15 Inflammation The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium topical solution in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. 5.16 Hematological Effects The effects of diclofenac sodium topical solution on platelet function were studied in 10 healthy subjects administered 80 drops four times a day for 7 days. There was no significant change in platelet aggregation following one week of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Check hemoglobin or hematocrit of patients on diclofenac sodium topical solution if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration and reversible. Carefully monitor patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution who may be adversely affected by alteration in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants. 5.17 Monitoring Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms in patients taking NSAIDs, monitor patients for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Check CBC and a chemistry profile periodically in patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs. Discontinue diclofenac sodium topical solution if abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen.","contraindication":"4.

ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events with diclofenac sodium topical solution are application site reactions. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact IGI Laboratories, Inc. at 1-856-697-1441, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of another drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to diclofenac sodium topical solution of 911 patients treated between 4 and 12 weeks (mean duration of 49 days) in seven Phase 3 controlled trials, as well as exposure of 793 patients treated in an open-label study, including 463 patients treated for at least 6 months, and 144 patients treated for at least 12 months. The population mean age was approximately 60 years, 89% of patients were Caucasians, 64% were females, and all patients had primary osteoarthritis. The most common adverse events with diclofenac sodium topical solution were application site skin reactions. These events were the most common reason for withdrawing from the studies. Application site reactions: In controlled trials, the most common treatment related adverse events in patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution were application site skin reactions. Application site reactions were characterized by one or more of the following: dryness, erythema, induration, vesicles, paresthesia, pruritus, vasodilation, acne, and urticaria. The most frequent of these reactions were dry skin (32%), contact dermatitis characterized by skin erythema and induration (9%), contact dermatitis with vescicles (2%) and pruritus (4%). In one controlled trial, a higher rate of contact dermatitis with vesicles (4%) was observed after treatment of 152 subjects with the combination of diclofenac sodium topical solution and oral diclofenac. In the open label uncontrolled long-term safety study, contact dermatitis occurred in 13% and contact dermatitis with vesicles in 10% of patients, generally within the first 6 months of exposure, leading to a withdrawal rate for an application site event of 14%. Adverse events common to the NSAID class: In controlled trials, subjects treated with diclofenac sodium topical solution experienced some adverse events associated with the NSAID class more frequently than subjects using placebo (constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, edema; see Table 1). The combination of diclofenac sodium topical solution and oral diclofenac, compared to oral diclofenac alone, resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage (3% vs. less than 1%), and more frequent abnormal creatinine (12% vs. 7%), urea (20% vs. 12%), and hemoglobin (13% vs. 9%), but no difference in elevation of liver transaminases. Table 1: lists all adverse reactions occurring in 1% of patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution, where the rate in the diclofenac sodium topical solution group exceeded placebo, from seven controlled studies conducted in patients with osteoarthritis. Since these trials were of different durations, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.

Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. In patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%. In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%). Allergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.","drugClass":"prilocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients-Intact Skin A thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is applied to intact skin and covered with an occlusive dressing (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION). Minor Dermal Procedures: For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture, apply 2.5 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1/2 the 5 g tube) over 20 to 25 cm 2 of skin surface for at least 1 hour. In controlled clinical trials using lidocaine and prilocaine cream, two sites were usually prepared in case there was a technical problem with cannulation or venipuncture at the first site. Major Dermal Procedures: For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream per 10 cm 2 of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours. Adult Male Genital Skin: As an adjunct prior to local anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1 g/10 cm 2 ) to the skin surface for 15 minutes. Local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Dermal analgesia can be expected to increase for up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist for 1 to 2 hours after removal of the cream. The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine absorbed during the period of application can be estimated from the information in Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose. Adult Female Patients-Genital Mucous Membranes For minor procedures on the female external genitalia, such as removal of condylomata acuminata, as well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer (5 to 10 grams) of lidocaine and prilocaine cream for 5 to 10 minutes. Occlusion is not necessary for absorption, but may be helpful to keep the cream in place. Patients should be lying down during the lidocaine and prilocaine cream application, especially if no occlusion is used. The procedure or the local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after the removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Pediatric Patients-Intact Skin The following are the maximum recommended doses, application areas and application times for lidocaine and prilocaine cream based on a child's age and weight: Age and Body Weight Requirements Maximum Total Dose of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream Maximum Application Area Maximum Application Time 0 up to 3 months or < 5 kg 1 g 10 cm 2 1 hour 3 up to 12 months and > 5 kg 2 g 20 cm 2 4 hours 1 to 6 years and > 10 kg 10 g 100 cm 2 4 hours 7 to 12 years and > 20 kg 20 g 200 cm 2 4 hours Please note: If a patient greater than 3 months old does not meet the minimum weight requirement, the maximum total dose of lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be restricted to that which corresponds to the patient's weight (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION). Practitioners should carefully instruct caregivers to avoid application of excessive amounts of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (see PRECAUTIONS). When applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream to the skin of young children, care must be taken to maintain careful observation of the child to prevent accidental ingestion of lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the occlusive dressing. A secondary protective covering to prevent inadvertent disruption of the application site may be useful. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be used in neonates with a gestational age less than 37 weeks nor in infants under the age of 12 months who are receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing agents (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS). When lidocaine and prilocaine cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered (see Individualization of Dose). The amount absorbed in the case of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is determined by the area over which it is applied and the duration of application under occlusion (see Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose). Although the incidence of systemic adverse reactions with lidocaine and prilocaine cream is very low, caution should be exercised, particularly when applying it over large areas and leaving it on for longer than 2 hours. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions can be expected to be directly proportional to the area and time of exposure (see Individualization of Dose).","activeIngredient":3098031},{"uuid":"47682-300","administrationRoute":"TOPICAL","dosageForm":"AEROSOL, SPRAY","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Green Guard Super Stat Blood Clotting First Aid","proprietaryName":"Unifirst First Aid Corporation","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses for help on control of superificial bleeding for temporary relief of pain and to help protect against skin infection in minor cuts minor scrapes minor burns","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions sake can well before using hold 6-8 inches from moist injured area spray until area is covered scab-like cover will gradually disappear as healing takes place or may be removed with soap and water for adult institutional use only not intended for use on children","activeIngredient":3130259},{"uuid":"69842-049","administrationRoute":"TOPICAL","dosageForm":"LIQUID","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Pain Relief","proprietaryName":"CVS","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses Temporarily relieves pain and itching due to: sunburn minor burns minor cuts scrapes insect bites minor skin irritations","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions shake well adults and children 2 years of age and older: apply to affected area not more than 3 to 4 times daily children under 2 years of age: ask a doctor to apply to face, spray into palm of hand and gently apply","activeIngredient":3196534},{"uuid":"52124-1166","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"GFA First Aid","proprietaryName":"Genuine First Aid, LLC","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses Provides, antiseptic germicidal skin preperation for minor invasive procedures","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"benzalkonium","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions Clean intended area thoroughly with pad.

These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions as result of sensitivity to lidocaine HCl are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches, hypotension and backache; 2 percent for shivering; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, nausea, respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.","drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Xylocaine Injection for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrinefree solutions. When larger volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated. There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Xylocaine is not approved for this use (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (ie, total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCl is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected. For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used. Epidural Anesthesia For epidural anesthesia, only the following dosage forms Xylocaine Injection are recommended: 1% without epinephrine 10 mL Polyamp DuoFit 1% without epinephrine 30 mL single dose solutions 1% with epinephrine 30 mL single dose solutions 1:200,000 1.5% without epinephrine 10 mL Polyamp DuoFit 1.5% without epinephrine 20 mL Polyamp DuoFit 1.5% with epinephrine 30 mL ampules, 30 mL single dose solutions 1:200,000 2% without epinephrine 10 mL Polyamp DuoFit 2% with epinephrine 20 mL ampules, 20 mL single dose solutions 1:200,000 Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units. These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent. In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 to 3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome). Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2 to 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine HCl should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. The test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in a manner that may have displaced the catheter. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10 to 15 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient epinephrine response within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral pallor, palpitations and nervousness in the unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients on beta blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic blood pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of anesthesia after administration of each test dose. The rapid injection of a large volume of Xylocaine Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered. In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter. MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED DOSAGES Adults For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia. The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly, five minutes between sides (see also discussion of paracervical block in PRECAUTIONS). For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults. Children It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body mass and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the childs age and weight. For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75 to 100 mg (1.5 to 2 mg/lb). The use of even more dilute solutions (ie, 0.25 to 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children. In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration. NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. The Injection is not to be used if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Table 1: Recommended Dosages THE ABOVE SUGGESTED CONCENTRATIONS AND VOLUMES SERVE ONLY AS A GUIDE. OTHER VOLUMES AND CONCENTRATIONS MAY BE USED PROVIDED THE TOTAL MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED DOSE IS NOT EXCEEDED. STERILIZATION, STORAGE AND TECHNICAL PROCEDURES *Dose determined by number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (2 to 3 mL/dermatome). Disinfecting agents containing heavy metals, which cause release of respective ions (mercury, zinc, copper, etc) should not be used for skin or mucous membrane disinfection as they have been related to incidents of swelling and edema. When chemical disinfection of multi-dose vials is desired, either isopropyl alcohol (91%) or ethyl alcohol (70%) is recommended. Many commercially available brands of rubbing alcohol, as well as solutions of ethyl alcohol not of USP grade, contain denaturants which are injurious to rubber and therefore are not to be used. Dosage forms listed as Xylocaine-MPF indicate single dose solutions that are Methyl Paraben Free (MPF).","activeIngredient":3070661},{"uuid":"69842-985","administrationRoute":"TOPICAL","dosageForm":"CREAM","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"HemAway","proprietaryName":"CVS Pharmacy, Inc","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses Temporarily relieves pain, itching and discomfort due to anorectal disorders and temporarily shrinks hemorrhoidal tissue.","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions Adults: when practical, cleanse the affected area with mild soap and warm water.

Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. In patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%. In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%). Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.","drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients-Intact Skin A thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is applied to intact skin and covered with an occlusive dressing (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION). Minor Dermal Procedures For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture, apply 2.5 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1/2 the 5 g tube) over 20 to 25 cm2 of skin surface for at least 1 hour. In controlled clinical trials using lidocaine and prilocaine cream, two sites were usually prepared in case there was a technical problem with cannulation or venipuncture at the first site. Major Dermal Procedures For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream per 10 cm2 of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours. Adult Male Genital Skin As an adjunct prior to local anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1 g/10 cm2 ) to the skin surface for 15 minutes. Local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Dermal analgesia can be expected to increase for up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist for 1 to 2 hours after removal of the cream. The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine absorbed during the period of application can be estimated from the information in Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose. Adult Female Patients-Genital Mucous Membranes For minor procedures on the female external genitalia, such as removal of condylomata acuminata, as well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer (5 to 10 grams) of lidocaine and prilocaine cream for 5 to 10 minutes. Occlusion is not necessary for absorption, but may be helpful to keep the cream in place. Patients should be lying down during the lidocaine and prilocaine cream application, especially if no occlusion is used. The procedure or the local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after the removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Pediatric Patients-Intact Skin The following are the maximum recommended doses, application areas and application times for lidocaine and prilocaine cream based on a child's age and weight: Age and Body Weight Requirements Maximum Total Dose of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream Maximum Application Area Maximum Application Time 0 up to 3 months or < 5 kg 1 g 10 cm2 1 hour 3 up to 12 months and > 5 kg 2 g 20 cm2 4 hours 1 to 6 years and > 10 kg 10 g 100 cm2 4 hours 7 to 12 years and > 20 kg 20 g 200 cm2 4 hours Please note: If a patient greater than 3 months old does not meet the minimum weight requirement, the maximum total dose of lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be restricted to that which corresponds to the patient's weight (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION ). Practitioners should carefully instruct caregivers to avoid application of excessive amounts of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (see PRECAUTIONS ). When applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream to the skin of young children, care must be taken to maintain careful observation of the child to prevent accidental ingestion of lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the occlusive dressing. A secondary protective covering to prevent inadvertent disruption of the application site may be useful. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be used in neonates with a gestational age less than 37 weeks nor in infants under the age of 12 months who are receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing agents (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS). When lidocaine and prilocaine cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered (see Individualization of Dose ). The amount absorbed in the case of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is determined by the area over which it is applied and the duration of application under occlusion (see Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose). Although the incidence of systemic adverse reactions with lidocaine and prilocaine cream is very low, caution should be exercised, particularly when applying it over large areas and leaving it on for longer than 2 hours. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions can be expected to be directly proportional to the area and time of exposure (see Individualization of Dose ).","activeIngredient":3060568},{"uuid":"52164-1102","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"ARC FIRST AID Contains 101 PIECES","proprietaryName":"American Red Cross","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":null,"warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"benzalkonium","maximumDoseSchedule":"Enter section text here","activeIngredient":3198549},{"uuid":"69313-635","administrationRoute":"TOPICAL","dosageForm":"PATCH","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"LidoFLEX","proprietaryName":"NAIMCO, INC.

A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma levels, which may be due to overdosage, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences which demand immediate counter-measures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. These adverse experiences are generally dose related and due to high plasma levels which may result from overdosage, rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance, or from unintentional intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (Total or High Spinal). Also, hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or underventilation due to cephalad extension of the motor level of anesthesia may occur. This may lead to secondary cardiac arrest if untreated. Patients over 65 years, particularly those with hypertension, may be at increased risk for experiencing the hypotensive effects of MARCAINE. Factors influencing plasma protein binding, such as acidosis, systemic diseases which alter protein production, or competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish individual tolerance. Central Nervous System Reactions:These are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, or tremors may occur, possibly proceeding to convulsions. However, excitement may be transient or absent, with depression being the first manifestation of an adverse reaction. This may quickly be followed by drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Other central nervous system effects may be nausea, vomiting, chills, and constriction of the pupils. The incidence of convulsions associated with the use of local anesthetics varies with the procedure used and the total dose administered. In a survey of studies of epidural anesthesia, overt toxicity progressing to convulsions occurred in approximately 0.1% of local anesthetic administrations. Cardiovascular System Reactions:High doses or unintentional intravascular injection may lead to high plasma levels and related depression of the myocardium, decreased cardiac output, heartblock, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest. (SeeWARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS,andOVERDOSAGE.) Allergic:Allergic-type reactions are rare and may occur as a result of sensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients, such as the antimicrobial preservative methylparaben contained in multiple-dose vials or sulfites in epinephrine-containing solutions. These reactions are characterized by signs such as urticaria, pruritus, erythema, angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema), tachycardia, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated temperature, and possibly, anaphylactoid-like symptomatology (including severe hypotension). Cross sensitivity among members of the amide-type local anesthetic group has been reported. The usefulness of screening for sensitivity has not been definitely established. Neurologic:The incidences of adverse neurologic reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical status of the patient. Many of these effects may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the drug. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter or needle may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered intrathecally and the physiological and physical effects of a dural puncture. A high spinal is characterized by paralysis of the legs, loss of consciousness, respiratory paralysis, and bradycardia. Neurologic effects following epidural or caudal anesthesia may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total spinal block); hypotension secondary to spinal block; urinary retention; fecal and urinary incontinence; loss of perineal sensation and sexual function; persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery; headache; backache; septic meningitis; meningismus; slowing of labor; increased incidence of forceps delivery; and cranial nerve palsies due to traction on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid. Neurologic effects following other procedures or routes of administration may include persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, paralysis, all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery.","drugClass":"povidone-iodine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered. Dosages of MARCAINE should be reduced for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional (incremental) doses should be used when feasible. For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks. There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. MARCAINE is not approved for this use (seeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In recommended doses, MARCAINE produces complete sensory block, but the effect on motor function differs among the three concentrations. 0.25%when used for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, produces incomplete motor block. Should be used for operations in which muscle relaxation is not important, or when another means of providing muscle relaxation is used concurrently. Onset of action may be slower than with the 0.5% or 0.75% solutions. 0.5%provides motor blockade for caudal, epidural, or nerve block, but muscle relaxation may be inadequate for operations in which complete muscle relaxation is essential. 0.75%produces complete motor block. Most useful for epidural block in abdominal operations requiring complete muscle relaxation, and for retrobulbar anesthesia. Not for obstetrical anesthesia. The duration of anesthesia with MARCAINE is such that for most indications, a single dose is sufficient. Maximum dosage limit must be individualized in each case after evaluating the size and physical status of the patient, as well as the usual rate of systemic absorption from a particular injection site. Most experience to date is with single doses of MARCAINE up to 225 mg with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 175 mg without epinephrine; more or less drug may be used depending on individualization of each case. These doses may be repeated up to once every three hours. In clinical studies to date, total daily doses have been up to 400 mg. Until further experience is gained, this dose should not be exceeded in 24 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect may be prolonged by the addition of epinephrine. The dosages in Table 1 have generally proved satisfactory and are recommended as a guide for use in the average adult. These dosages should be reduced for elderly or debilitated patients. Until further experience is gained, MARCAINE is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 12 years. MARCAINE is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical blocks, and is not recommended for intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier Block). Use in Epidural Anesthesia:During epidural administration of MARCAINE, 0.5% and 0.75% solutions should be administered in incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL with sufficient time between doses to detect toxic manifestations of unintentional intravascular or intrathecal injection. In obstetrics, only the 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations should be used; incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL of the 0.5% solution not exceeding 50 mg to 100 mg at any dosing interval are recommended. Repeat doses should be preceded by a test dose containing epinephrine if not contraindicated. Use only the single-dose ampuls and single-dose vials for caudal or epidural anesthesia; the multiple-dose vials contain a preservative and therefore should not be used for these procedures. Test Dose for Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Blocks:The Test Dose of MARCAINE (0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine in a 3 mL ampul) is recommended for use as a test dose when clinical conditions permit prior to caudal and lumbar epidural blocks. This may serve as a warning of unintended intravascular or subarachnoid injection. (SeePRECAUTIONS.) The pulse rate and other signs should be monitored carefully immediately following each test dose administration to detect possible intravascular injection, and adequate time for onset of spinal block should be allotted to detect possible intrathecal injection. An intravascular or subarachnoid injection is still possible even if results of the test dose are negative. The test dose itself may produce a systemic toxic reaction, high spinal or cardiovascular effects from the epinephrine. (SeeWARNINGSandOVERDOSAGE.) Use in Dentistry:The 0.5% concentration with epinephrine is recommended for infiltration and block injection in the maxillary and mandibular area when a longer duration of local anesthetic action is desired, such as for oral surgical procedures generally associated with significant postoperative pain. The average dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) per injection site will usually suffice; an occasional second dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) may be used if necessary to produce adequate anesthesia after making allowance for 2 to 10 minutes onset time. (SeeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) The lowest effective dose should be employed and time should be allowed between injections; it is recommended that the total dose for all injection sites, spread out over a single dental sitting, should not ordinarily exceed 90 mg for a healthy adult patient (ten 1.8 mL injections of 0.5% MARCAINE with epinephrine). Injections should be made slowly and with frequent aspirations. Until further experience is gained, MARCAINE in dentistry is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 12 years. Unused portions of solution not containing preservatives, i.e., those supplied in single-dose ampuls and single-dose vials, should be discarded following initial use. This product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are discolored or which contain particulate matter should not be administered. Table 1. Recommended Concentrations and Doses of MARCAINE Type of Block Conc.

Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.

If chemical disinfection of anesthetic cartridges is desired, either isopropyl alcohol (91%) or 70% ethyl alcohol is recommended. Many commercially available brands of rubbing alcohol, as well as solutions of ethyl alcohol not of U.S.P grade, contain denaturants that are injurious to rubber and, therefore, are not to be used. It is recommended that chemical disinfection be accomplished just prior to use by wiping the cartridge cap thoroughly with a pledge of cotton that has been moistened with recommended alcohol. Certain metallic ions (mercury, zinc, copper, etc.) have been related to swelling and edema after local anesthesia in dentistry. Therefore, chemical disinfectants containing or releasing these ions are not recommended. Antirust tablets usually contain sodium nitrite or some similar agents that may be capable of releasing metal ions. Because of this, aluminium sealed cartridges should not be kept in such solutions. Quaternary ammonium salts, such as benzalkonium chloride, are electrolytically incompatible with aluminium. Cartridges of Octocaine Injections are sealed with aluminium caps and therefore should not be immersed in any solution containing these salts. To avoid leakage of solutions during injection, be sure to penetrate the center of the rubber diaphragm when loading the syringe. An off-center penetration produces an oval shaped puncture that allows leakage around the needle. Other causes of leakage and breakage include badly worn syringes, aspirating syringes with bent harpoons, the use of syringes not designed to take 1.7 mL cartridges, and inadvertent freezing. Cracking of glass cartridges is most often the result of an attempt to use a cartridge with an extruded plunger. An extruded plunger loses its lubrication and can be forced back into the cartridge only with difficulty. Cartridges with extruded plungers should be discarded. Store at controlled room temperature, below 25C (77F).","adverseReaction":"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide-type local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels (which may be caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption, unintended intravascular injection or slow metabolic degradation), injection technique, volume of injection, hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported : Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular system Cardiovascular manifestations in response to lidocaine are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.In addition, the beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulating action of epinephrine may lead to excitatory cardiovascular responses, such as tachycardia, palpitations, and hypertension. Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position. Less commonly, they may result from a direct effect of the drug. Failure to recognize the premonitory signs such as sweating, a feeling of faintness, changes in pulse or sensorium may result in progressive cerebral hypoxia and seizure or serious cardiovascular catastrophe. Management consists of placing the patient in the recumbent position and ventilation with oxygen. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require the administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor (e.g, ephedrine) as directed by the clinical situation. Allergic reactions Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, anaphylactoid reactions, or dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Neurologic reactions The incidences of adverse reactions (e.g., persistent neurologic deficit) associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the technique employed, the total dose of local anesthetic administered, the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical condition of the patient. Persistent paresthesias of the lips, tongue, and oral tissues have been reported with the use of lidocaine, with slow, incomplete, or no recovery. These post-marketing events have been reported chiefly following nerve blocks in the mandible and have involved the trigeminal nerve and its branches.","drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of Octocaine (Lidocaine and Epinephrine Injections, USP) depends on the physical status of the patient, the area of the oral cavity to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the oral tissues, and the technique of anesthesia used. The least volume of solution that results in effective local anesthesia should be administered; time should be allowed between injections to observe the patient for manifestations of an adverse reaction. For specific techniques and procedures of a local anesthesia in the oral cavity, refer to standard textbooks. For most routine dental procedures, Octocaine (Lidocaine and Epinephrine 1:100,000) Injection is preferred. However, when greater depth and a more pronounced hemostasis are required, a 1:50,000 Epinephrine concentration should be used. Dosage requirements should be determined on an individual basis. In oral infiltration and / or mandibular block, initial dosages of 1.0 - 5.0 mL (1/2 to 2.5 cartridges) of Octocaine Injections are usually effective. In children under 10 years of age, it is rarely necessary to administer more than one-half cartridge (0.9-1.0 mL or 18-20 mg of lidocaine) per procedure to achieve local anesthesia for a procedure involving a single tooth. In maxillary infiltration, this amount will often suffice to the treatment of two or even three teeth. In the mandibular block, however, satisfactory anesthesia achieved with this amount of drug, will allow treatment of the teeth of an entire quadrant. Aspiration is recommended since it reduces the possibility of intravascular injection, thereby keeping the incidence of side effects and anesthetic failures to a minimum. Moreover, injection should always be made slowly. Maximum recommended dosages for Lidocaine and Epinephrine Injections. Adult For normal healthy adults, the amount of lidocaine HCI administered should be kept below 500 mg, and in any case, should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.2 mg/lb) of body weight. Pediatric Pediatric patients : It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for pediatric patients since this varies as a function of age and weight. For pediatric patients of less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and normal body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule). For example, in pediatric patients of five years weighing 50 Ibs, the dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 75-100mg when calculated according to Clark's rule. In any case, the maximum dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.2 mg/lb) of body weight. NOTE : Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. Solutions that are discolored and / or contain particulate matter should not be used and any unused portion of a cartridge of Octocaine Injections should be discarded.","activeIngredient":3065779},{"uuid":"55154-6964","administrationRoute":"INFILTRATION","dosageForm":"INJECTION, SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Lidocaine Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Cardinal Health","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks, when the accepted procedures for these techniques as described in standard textbooks are observed.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type.","howSupplied":"HOW SUPPLIED Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is supplied as follows: NDC Container Concentration Size Total (mg) Single-dose: 0409-4278-01 Glass Teartop Vial 0.5% (5 mg/mL) 50 mL 250 0409-4713-01 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 2 mL (bulk 400 units) 20 0409-4713-02 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 5 mL 50 0409-4713-05 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 5 mL (bulk 400 units) 50 0409-4713-20 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 20 mL 200 0409-4713-32 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 2 mL 20 0409-4713-62 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 2 mL (bulk 800 units) 20 0409-4713-65 Glass Ampul 1% (10 mg/mL) 5 mL (bulk 800 units) 50 0409-4279-02 Glass Teartop Vial 1% (10 mg/mL) 30 mL 300 0409-4270-01 Sterile Glass Teartop Vial 1% (10 mg/mL) 30 mL 300 0409-4776-01 Glass Ampul 1.5% (15 mg/mL) 20 mL 300 0409-4056-01 Sterile Glass Ampul 1.5% (15 mg/mL) 20 mL 300 0409-4282-01 Glass Ampul 2% (20 mg/mL) 2 mL 40 0409-4282-02 Glass Ampul 2% (20 mg/mL) 10 mL 200 Multiple-dose: 0409-4275-01 Plastic Fliptop Vial 0.5% (5 mg/mL) 50 mL 250 0409-4276-01 Plastic Fliptop Vial 1% (10 mg/mL) 20 mL 200 0409-4276-02 Plastic Fliptop Vial 1% (10 mg/mL) 50 mL 500 0409-4277-01 Plastic Fliptop Vial 2% (20 mg/mL) 20 mL 400 0409-4277-02 Plastic Fliptop Vial 2% (20 mg/mL) 50 mL 1000 Single-dose products are preservative-free.

These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System: CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest.

Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System: Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic: Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Neurologic: The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches, hypotension and backache; 2 percent for shivering; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, nausea, respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.","drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required only solutions containing epinephrine should be used, except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated. There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Lidocaine is not approved for this use (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected. For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single-dose vial containing 0.5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP should be used. Epidural Anesthesia For epidural anesthesia, only the following available specific products of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection by Hospira are recommended: 1%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 mL single-dose teartop vials 1.5%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 mL single-dose ampuls 2%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 mL single-dose ampuls Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block provided they are employed as single dose units. These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent. In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 23 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome). Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block: As a precaution against the adverse experiences sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 23 mL of 1.5% lidocaine hydrochloride should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. The test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in a manner that may have displaced the catheter. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (1015 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient \"epinephrine response\" within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral pallor, palpitations and nervousness in the unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients on beta-blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic blood pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of anesthesia after administration of each test dose. The rapid injection of a large volume of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered. In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solutions into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter. Maximum Recommended Dosages NOTE: The products accompanying this insert do not contain epinephrine. Adults: For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine, the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia. The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One-half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly five minutes between sides. (See also discussion of paracervical block in PRECAUTIONS ). For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults. Children: It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body mass and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the childs age and weight. For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75 100 mg (1.5 2 mg/lb). The use of even more dilute solutions (i.e., 0.25 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children. In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. Solutions that are discolored and/or contain particulate matter should not be used.

Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base have been reported. The relationship to Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base. Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base. In patients treated with Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%. In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base-treated patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%). Allergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.","drugClass":"lidocaine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients-Intact Skin A thick layer of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base is applied to intact skin and covered with an occlusive dressing (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION). Minor Dermal Procedures: For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture, apply 2.5 grams of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base (1/2 the 5 g tube) over 20 to 25 cm 2 of skin surface for at least 1 hour. In controlled clinical trials using Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base, two sites were usually prepared in case there was a technical problem with cannulation or venipuncture at the first site. Major Dermal Procedures: For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Baseper 10 cm 2 of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours. Adult Male Genital Skin: As an adjunct prior to local anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base (1 g/10 cm 2) to the skin surface for 15 minutes. Local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after removal of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base. Dermal analgesia can be expected to increase for up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist for 1 to 2 hours after removal of the cream. The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine absorbed during the period of application can be estimated from the information in Table 2, in Individualization of Dose. Adult Female Patients-Genital Mucous Membranes For minor procedures on the female external genitalia, such as removal of condylomata acuminata, as well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer (5 to 10 grams) of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base for 5 to 10 minutes. Occlusion is not necessary for absorption, but may be helpful to keep the cream in place. Patients should be lying down during the Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base application, especially if no occlusion is used. The procedure or the local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after the removal of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base. Pediatric Patients-Intact Skin The following are the maximum recommended doses, application areas and application times for Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base based on a child's age and weight: Please note: If a patient greater than 3 months old does not meet the minimum weight requirement, the maximum total dose of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base should be restricted to that which corresponds to the patient's weight (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION). Practitioners should carefully instruct caregivers to avoid application of excessive amounts of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base (see PRECAUTIONS). When applying Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base to the skin of young children, care must be taken to maintain careful observation of the child to prevent accidental ingestion of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base or the occlusive dressing. A secondary protective covering to prevent inadvertent disruption of the application site may be useful. Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base should not be used in neonates with a gestational age less than 37 weeks nor in infants under the age of 12 months who are receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing agents (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS). When Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered (see Individualization of Dose). The amount absorbed in the case of Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base is determined by the area over which it is applied and the duration of application under occlusion (see Table 2, in Individualization of Dose). Although the incidence of systemic adverse reactions with Compounded Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream Base is very low, caution should be exercised, particularly when applying it over large areas and leaving it on for longer than 2 hours. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions can be expected to be directly proportional to the area and time of exposure (see Individualization of Dose).","activeIngredient":3092756},{"uuid":"59088-705","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Prizotral","proprietaryName":"PureTek Corporation","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS For the temporary relief of pain and itching associated with minor burns, sunburn, minor cuts, scrapes, insect bites, and minor skin irritation.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Tuberculous or fungal lesions of skin vaccinia, varicella and acute herpes simplex and in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.

For those patients who have not healed after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 4 to 8 week course of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules may be considered. In infants 1 month to less than 1 year, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are indicated for short-term treatment (up to 6 weeks) of erosive esophagitis due to acid-mediated GERD. Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are indicated to maintain symptom resolution and healing of erosive esophagitis.

Controlled studies do not extend beyond 6 months. 1.4 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsule USP is indicated for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy:In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. (5.1) Acute Interstitial Nephritis: Observedin patients taking PPIs. (5.2) Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea: PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk (5.3) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue esomeprazole magnesium and refer to specialist for evaluation. (5.5) Interaction with Clopidogrel: Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium. (5.6) Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.7) Hypomagnesemia: Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. (5.8) Interaction with St. Johns Wort or Rifampin: Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium. (5.9, 7.3) Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increased chromogranin A (CgA) levels may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors, temporarily stop esomeprazole magnesium at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels. (5.10, 12.2) Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider temporary withdrawal of esomeprazole magnesium. (5.11, 7.7) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole magnesium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including esomeprazole magnesium. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like esomeprazole magnesium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with esomeprazole magnesium, refer to Warnings and Precautions section of the corresponding prescribing information. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.6 Interaction with Clopidogrel Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole magnesium consider alternative anti-platelet therapy [seeDrug Interactions (7.3)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.8 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] 5.9 Interaction with St. Johns Wort or Rifampin Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. Johns Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations. [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium with St. Johns Wort, or rifampin. 5.10 Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.11 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.7)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esomeprazole magnesium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to substituted benzimidazoles or to any component of the formulation.

Adults The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in over 15,000 patients (aged 18 to 84 years) in clinical trials worldwide including over 8,500 patients in the United States and over 6,500 patients in Europe and Canada. Over 2,900 patients were treated in long-term studies for up to 6 to 12 months. In general, esomeprazole magnesium was well tolerated in both short and long-term clinical trials. The safety in the treatment of healing of erosive esophagitis was assessed in four randomized comparative clinical trials, which included 1,240 patients on esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg, 2,434 patients on esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg, and 3,008 patients on omeprazole 20 mg daily. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (1%) in all three groups were headache (5.5, 5, and 3.8, respectively) and diarrhea (no difference among the three groups). Nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, and dry mouth occurred at similar rates among patients taking esomeprazole magnesium or omeprazole. Additional adverse reactions that were reported as possibly or probably related to esomeprazole magnesium with an incidence < 1% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, substernal chest pain, facial edema, peripheral edema, hot flushes, fatigue, fever, flu-like disorder, generalized edema, leg edema, malaise, pain, rigors; Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia; Endocrine: goiter; Gastrointestinal: bowel irregularity, constipation aggravated, dyspepsia, dysphagia, dysplasia GI, epigastric pain, eructation, esophageal disorder, frequent stools, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, GI symptoms not otherwise specified, hiccup, melena, mouth disorder, pharynx disorder, rectal disorder, serum gastrin increased, tongue disorder, tongue edema, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting; Hearing: earache, tinnitus; Hematologic: anemia, anemia hypochromic, cervical lymphadenopathy, epistaxis, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Hepatic: bilirubinemia, hepatic function abnormal, SGOT increased, SGPT increased; Metabolic/Nutritional: glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, increased alkaline phosphatase, thirst, vitamin B12 deficiency, weight increase, weight decrease; Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis aggravated, arthropathy, cramps, fibromyalgia syndrome, hernia, polymyalgia rheumatica; Nervous System/Psychiatric: anorexia, apathy, appetite increased, confusion, depression aggravated, dizziness, hypertonia, nervousness, hypoesthesia, impotence, insomnia, migraine, migraine aggravated, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, tremor, vertigo, visual field defect; Reproductive: dysmenorrhea, menstrual disorder, vaginitis; Respiratory: asthma aggravated, coughing, dyspnea, larynx edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis; Skin and Appendages: acne, angioedema, dermatitis, pruritus, pruritus ani, rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular, skin inflammation, sweating increased, urticaria; Special Senses: otitis media, parosmia, taste loss, taste perversion; Urogenital: abnormal urine, albuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, fungal infection, hematuria, micturition frequency, moniliasis, genital moniliasis, polyuria; Visual: conjunctivitis, vision abnormal. The following potentially clinically significant laboratory changes in clinical trials, irrespective of relationship to esomeprazole magnesium, were reported in 1% of patients: increased creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, serum gastrin, potassium, sodium, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Decreases were seen in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, potassium, sodium, and thyroxine. Endoscopic findings that were reported as adverse reactions include: duodenitis, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, esophageal ulceration, esophageal varices, gastric ulcer, gastritis, hernia, benign polyps or nodules, Barretts esophagus, and mucosal discoloration. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions during 6-month maintenance treatment was similar to placebo. There were no differences in types of related adverse reactions seen during maintenance treatment up to 12 months compared to short-term treatment. Two placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 710 patients for the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most common adverse reactions that were reported as possibly or probably related to esomeprazole magnesium were diarrhea (4.3%), headache (3.8%), and abdominal pain (3.8%). Pediatrics The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in 316 pediatric and adolescent patients aged 1 to 17 years in four clinical trials for the treatment of symptomatic GERD [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In 109 pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years, the most frequently reported (at least 1%) treatment-related adverse reactions in these patients were diarrhea (2.8%), headache (1.9%) and somnolence (1.9%). In 149 pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years the most frequently reported (at least 2%) treatment-related adverse reactions in these patients were headache (8.1%), abdominal pain (2.7%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea (2%). The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in 167 pediatric patients from birth to Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional adverse reactions specific to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions that occurred were limited to those observed when using esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin alone. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions for patients who received triple therapy for 10 days were diarrhea (9.2%), taste perversion (6.6%), and abdominal pain (3.7%). No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at higher rates with triple therapy than were observed with esomeprazole magnesium alone. For more information on adverse reactions with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions sections. In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional increased laboratory abnormalities particular to these drug combinations were observed. For more information on laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions section. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole magnesium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system: Blood and Lymphatic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; Eye: blurred vision; Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis; stomatitis; microscopic colitis ; Hepatobiliary: hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice; Immune System: anaphylactic reaction/shock; systemic lupus erythematosus; Infections and Infestations: GI candidiasis; Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea; Metabolism and nutritional disorders: hypomagnesemia, with or without hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture; Nervous System: hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance; Psychiatric: aggression, agitation, depression, hallucination; Renal and Urinary: interstitial nephritis; Reproductive System and Breast: gynecomastia; Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal: bronchospasm; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue: alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","drugClass":"ibuprofen","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Esomeprazole magnesium is supplied as delayed-release capsules for oral administration.

For patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), a dose of 20 mg of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules should not be exceeded [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Directions for use specific to the route and available methods of administration for each of these dosage forms are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Administration Options Administration Options (See text following table for additional instructions.) Dosage Form Route Options Delayed-Release Capsules Oral Capsule can be swallowed whole. -or- Capsule can be opened and mixed with applesauce. Delayed-Release Capsules Nasogastric Tube Capsule can be opened and the intact granules emptied into a syringe and delivered through the nasogastric tube. Esomeprazole Magnesium Delayed-Release Capsules Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules should be swallowed whole. Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsule can be opened, and the granules inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The granules should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately: do not store for future use. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The granules should not be chewed or crushed. If the granules/applesauce mixture is not used in its entirety, the remaining mixture should be discarded immediately. For patients who have a nasogastric tube in place, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules can be opened and the intact granules emptied into a 60 mL catheter tipped syringe and mixed with 50 mL of water. It is important to only use a catheter tipped syringe when administering esomeprazole magnesium through a nasogastric tube. Replace the plunger and shake the syringe vigorously for 15 seconds. Hold the syringe with the tip up and check for granules remaining in the tip. Attach the syringe to a nasogastric tube and deliver the contents of the syringe through the nasogastric tube into the stomach. After administering the granules, the nasogastric tube should be flushed with additional water. Do not administer the granules if they have dissolved or disintegrated. The mixture must be used immediately after preparation.","activeIngredient":3074304},{"uuid":"69103-2400","administrationRoute":"TOPICAL","dosageForm":"OINTMENT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Biotic-Plus","proprietaryName":"Provision Medical","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses First aid to help prevent infection and provide temporary relief in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns The Provision First Aid Line Manufactured for Provision Medical Products Palm Desert, CA 92211","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"bacitracin","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions adults & children 2 years & older: clean affected area, apply amount (equal to surface area of a tip of finger) on area 1-3 times daily.

The severity of these reactions are dose and schedule dependent. Cellular changes in the morphology of bone marrow and peripheral smears can be expected. Following 5-day constant infusions or acute injections of 50 mg/m2 to 600 mg/m2, white cell depression follows a biphasic course. Regardless of initial count, dosage level, or schedule, there is an initial fall starting the first 24 hours with a nadir at days 7 to 9. This is followed by a brief rise which peaks around the twelth day. A second and deeper fall reaches nadir at days 15 to 24. Then there is a rapid rise to above baseline in the next 10 days. Platelet depression is noticeable at 5 days with a peak depression occurring between days 12 to 15. Thereupon, a rapid rise to above baseline occurs in the next 10 days. Infectious Complications Injection Viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or saprophytic infections, in any location in the body may be associated with the use of cytarabine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents following immunosuppressant doses that affect cellular or humoral immunity. These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. The Cytarabine (Ara-C) Syndrome A cytarabine syndrome has been described by Castleberry. It is characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain, occasionally chest pain, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis and malaise. It usually occurs 6 to 12 hours following drug administration. Corticosteroids have been shown to be beneficial in treating or preventing this syndrome. If the symptoms of the syndrome are deemed treatable, corticosteroids should be contemplated as well as continuation of therapy with cytarabine. Most Frequent Adverse Reactions Anorexia Oralandanalinflammation Rash Nausea oruclearation Thrombophlebitis Vomiting Hepaticdysfunction Bleeding(allsites) Diarrhea Fever Nauseaandvomitingare mostfrequentfollowingrapid intravenousinjection. Less Frequent Adverse Reactions Sepsis Sorethroat Conjunctivitis(mayoccurwithrash) Pneumonia Esophagealulceration Dizziness Cellulitesatinjectionsite Esophagitis Alopecia Skinulceration Chestpain Anaphylaxis(seeWARNING) Urinaryretention Pericarditis Allergicedema Renaldysfunction Bowelnecrosis Pruritis Neuritis Abdominalpain Shortnessofbreath Neuraltoxicity Pancreatitis Urticaria Freckling Headache Jaundice Experimental Doses Severe and at times fatal CNS, GI and pulmonary toxicity (different from that seen with conventional therapy regimens of cytarabine) has been reported following some experimental dose schedules of cytarabine. These reactions include reversible corneal toxicity and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, which may be prevented or diminished by prophylaxis with a local corticosteroid eye drop; cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, including personality changes, somnolence and coma, usually reversible; severe gastrointestinal ulceration, including pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis leading to peritonitis; sepsis and liver abscess; pulmonary edema, liver damage with increased hyperbilirubinemia; bowel necrosis; and necrotizing colitis. Rarely, severe skin rash, leading to desquamation has been reported. Complete alopecia is more commonly seen with experimental high dose therapy than with standard treatment programs using cytarabine. If experimental high dose therapy is used, do not use a preparation containing benzyl alcohol. Cases of cardiomyopathy with subsequent death have been reported following experimental high dose therapy with cytarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide when used for bone marrow transplant preparation. This cardiac toxicity may be schedule dependent. A syndrome of sudden respiratory distress, rapidly progressing to pulmonary edema and radiographically pronounced cardiomegaly has been reported following experimental high dose therapy with cytarabine used for the treatment of relapsed leukemia from one institution in 16/72 patients. The outcome of this syndrome can be fatal. Two patients with adult acute non-lymphocytic leukemia developed peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies after consolidation with high-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase. Patients treated with high-dose cytarabine should be observed for neuropathy since dose schedule alterations may be needed to avoid irreversible neurologic disorders. Ten patients treated with experimental intermediate doses of cytarabine (1 g/m2) with and without other chemotherapeutic agents (meta-AMSA, daunorubicin, etoposide) at various dose regimes developed a diffuse interstitial pneumonitis without clear cause that may have been related to the cytarabine. Two cases of pancreatitis have been reported following experimental doses of cytarabine injection and numerous other drugs. Cytarabine injection could have been the causative agent.","drugClass":"cytarabine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cytarabine Injection is not active orally. The schedule and method of administration varies with the program of therapy to be used. Cytarabine Injection may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally (preservative free preparation only). Thrombophlebitis has occurred at the site of drug injection or infusion in some patients, and rarely patients have noted pain and inflammation at subcutaneous injection sites. In most instances, however, the drug has been well tolerated. Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drugs rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anticancer drugs is 100 mg/m2/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1 to 7) or 100 mg/m2 IV every 12 hours (Days 1 to 7). The literature should be consulted for the current recommendations for use in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Intrathecal Use in Meningeal Leukemia Cytarabine injection has been used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m2 every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy. Cytarabine injection given intrathecally may cause systemic toxicity and careful monitoring of the hematopoietic system is indicated. Modification of other anti-leukemia therapy may be necessary. Major toxicity is rare. The most frequently reported reactions after intrathecal administration were nausea, vomiting and fever; these reactions are mild and self-limiting. Paraplegia has been reported. Necrotizing leukoencephalopathy occurred in 5 children; these patients had also been treated with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone, as well as by central nervous system radiation. Isolated neurotoxicity has been reported. Blindness occurred in two patients in remission whose treatment had consisted of combination systemic chemotherapy, prophylactic central nervous system radiation and intrathecal Cytarabine Injection. When Cytarabine Injection is administered both intrathecally and intravenously within a few days, there is an increased risk of spinal cord toxicity, however, in serious life-threatening disease, concurrent use of intravenous and intrathecal Cytarabine Injection is left to the discretion of the treating physician. Focal leukemic involvement of the central nervous system may not respond to intrathecal Cytarabine Injection and may better be treated with radiotherapy. Chemical Stability of Infusion Solutions Chemical stability studies were performed by HPLC on Cytarabine Injection in infusion solutions. These studies showed that when Cytarabine Injection was added to Water for Injection, 5% Dextrose in Water or Sodium Chloride Injection, 94 to 96 percent of the cytarabine was present after 192 hours storage at room temperature. Parenteral drugs should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. HANDLING AND DISPOSAL Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-cancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-7 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.","activeIngredient":3065139},{"uuid":"68727-745","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, POWDER, LYOPHILIZED, FOR SUSPENSION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"VYXEOS","proprietaryName":"Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VYXEOS is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). VYXEOS is a liposomal combination of daunorubicin, an anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor, and cytarabine, a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor, that is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious or fatal hemorrhagic events with associated prolonged thrombocytopenia have occurred with VYXEOS. Monitor blood counts regularly until recovery. (5.2) Cardiotoxicity: VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients with cardiac function that is less than normal. Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of continuing treatment outweighs the risk. (2.2, 5.3) If severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue VYXEOS, treat according to standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (2.2, 5.4) Daunorubicin has been associated with local tissue necrosis at the site of drug extravasation. Administer VYXEOS with care. (5.6) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.7, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Do Not Interchange With Other Daunorubicin And/Or Cytarabine-Containing Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the dose and schedule recommendations for VYXEOS are different from those for daunorubicin hydrochloride injection, cytarabine injection, daunorubicin citrate liposome injection, and cytarabine liposome injection. Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid dosing errors. Do not substitute other preparations of daunorubicin or cytarabine for VYXEOS. 5.2 Hemorrhage Serious or fatal hemorrhage events, including fatal central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, associated with prolonged severe thrombocytopenia, have occurred in patients treated with VYXEOS. In Study 1 (NCT01696084), the incidence of any grade hemorrhagic events during the entire treatment period was 74% of patients on the VYXEOS arm and 56% on the control arm.The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (36% in VYXEOS arm and 18% in control arm). Grade 3 or greater events occurred in 12% of VYXEOS treated patients and 8% of patients treated with 7+3. Fatal treatment-emergent CNS hemorrhage not in the setting of progressive disease occurred in 2% of patients on the VYXEOS arm and in 0.7% of patients on the control arm. Monitor blood counts regularly until recovery and administer platelet transfusion support as required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Cardiotoxicity VYXEOS contains the anthracycline daunorubicin, which has a known risk of cardiotoxicity. Prior therapy with anthracyclines, pre-existing cardiac disease, previous radiotherapy to the mediastinum, or concomitant use of cardiotoxic drugs may increase the risk of daunorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity. Prior to administering VYXEOS, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and assess cardiac function by multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scan or echocardiography (ECHO). Repeat MUGA or ECHO determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to consolidation with VYXEOS and as clinically required. Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of initiating or continuing treatment outweighs the risk. VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients with LVEF that is less than normal. Total cumulative doses of non-liposomal daunorubicin greater than 550 mg/m2 have been associated with an increased incidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure. The tolerable limit appears lower (400 mg/m2) in patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum. Calculate the lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure prior to each cycle of VYXEOS. VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients whose lifetime anthracycline exposure has reached the maximum cumulative limit. The exposure to daunorubicin following each cycle of VYXEOS is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Cumulative Exposure of Daunorubicin per Cycle of VYXEOS Therapy Daunorubicin per Dose Number of Doses per Cycle Daunorubicin per Cycle First Induction Cycle 44 mg/m2 3 132 mg/m2 Second Induction Cycle 44 mg/m2 2 88 mg/m2 Each Consolidation Cycle 29 mg/m2 2 58 mg/m2 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions. If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs, interrupt or slow the rate of infusion with VYXEOS and manage symptoms. If a severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue VYXEOS permanently, treat symptoms according to the standard of care, and monitor until symptoms resolve [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.5 Copper Overload Reconstituted VYXEOS contains 5 mg/mL copper gluconate, of which 14% is elemental copper. There is no clinical experience with VYXEOS in patients with Wilsons disease or other copper-related metabolic disorders. The maximum theoretical total exposure of copper under the recommended VYXEOS dosing regimen is 106 mg/m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Consult with a hepatologist and nephrologist with expertise in managing acute copper toxicity in patients with Wilsons disease treated with VYXEOS. Monitor total serum copper, serum non-ceruloplasmin bound copper, 24-hour urine copper levels and serial neuropsychological examinations in these patients. Use VYXEOS in patients with Wilsons disease only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with signs or symptoms of acute copper toxicity. 5.6 Tissue Necrosis Daunorubicin has been associated with severe local tissue necrosis at the site of drug extravasation. Administer VYXEOS by the intravenous route only. Do not administer by intramuscular or subcutaneous route. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies with daunorubicin and cytarabine, VYXEOS can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of VYXEOS, daunorubicin, or cytarabine in pregnant women. Daunorubicin and cytarabine are reproductive and developmental toxicants in multiple species (mice, rats, and/or dogs), starting at a dose that was approximately 0.02 times the exposure in patients at the recommended human dose on an mg/m2 basis. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VYXEOS. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of VYXEOS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of VYXEOS is contraindicated in patients with the following: History of serious hypersensitivity reaction to cytarabine, daunorubicin, or any component of the formulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )].

The safety of VYXEOS was determined in a randomized trial for adults with newly-diagnosed tAML or AML-MRC [see Clinical Studies (14)] which included 153 patients treated with VYXEOS and 151 patients treated with a standard combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3). At study entry, patients were required to have a LVEF of at least 50% and a prior lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure less than 368 mg/m2 daunorubicin (or equivalent). On study, the median number of cycles administered was 2 (range, 14 cycles) on the VYXEOS arm and 1 (range, 14 cycles) on the control arm. The median cumulative daunorubicin dose was 189 mg/m2 (range, 44337 mg/m2) on the VYXEOS arm and 186 mg/m2 (range, 44532 mg/m2) on the control arm. Nine patients each on the VYXEOS arm (6%) and the control arm (6%) had a fatal adverse reaction on treatment or within 30 days of therapy that was not in the setting of progressive disease. Fatal adverse reactions on the VYXEOS arm included infection, CNS hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. Overall, all-cause day-30 mortality was 6% in the VYXEOS arm and 11% in the control arm. During the first 60 days of the study, 14% (21/153) of patients died in the VYXEOS arm vs. 21% (32/151) of patients in the 7+3 treatment group. The most common serious adverse reactions (incidence 5%) on the VYXEOS arm were dyspnea, myocardial toxicity, sepsis, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, bacteremia and hemorrhage. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of VYXEOS in 18% (28/153) of patients, and 13% (20/151) in the control arm. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation on the VYXEOS arm included prolonged cytopenias, infection, cardiotoxicity, respiratory failure, hemorrhage (GI and CNS), renal insufficiency, colitis, and generalized medical deterioration. The most common adverse reactions (incidence 25%) in patients on the VYXEOS arm were hemorrhagic events, febrile neutropenia, rash, edema, nausea, mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, dyspnea, headache, cough, decreased appetite, arrhythmia, pneumonia, bacteremia, chills, sleep disorders, and vomiting. The incidences of common adverse drug reactions during the induction phase in Study 1 are presented in Table3.

During the consolidation phase (both consolidation cycles pooled) the two most common adverse reactions on the VYXEOS arm are the same as those during induction, hemorrhagic events and febrile neutropenia. These occurred at lower rates in the pooled consolidation phase (43% and 29%, respectively), compared to the induction phase. All of the common adverse reactions (10% incidence in the VYXEOS arm) seen in the pooled consolidation phase were also seen in the induction phase. These occurred at lower incidence in the consolidation phase, with the exception of chills, dizziness and pyrexia, where the incidences were relatively similar across the induction and consolidation cycles. Other notable adverse drug reactions that occurred in less than 10% of patients treated with VYXEOS during induction or consolidation included: Ear and labyrinth disorders: Deafness, Deafness unilateral Eye Disorders: Eye conjunctivitis, Dry eye, Eye edema, Eye swelling, Eye irritation, Eye pain, Ocular discomfort, Ocular hyperemia, Periorbital edema, Scleral hyperemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia Psychiatric disorders: Hallucinations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pneumonitis Laboratory Abnormalities All patients developed severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

(2) Consolidation: VYXEOS (daunorubicin 29 mg/m2 and cytarabine 65 mg/m2) liposome via intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. (2) 2.1 Recommended Dosage A full VYXEOS course consists of 1-2 cycles of Induction and up to 2 cycles of Consolidation at the dose and schedule listed in Table 1. Prior to initiating each cycle of VYXEOS, calculate the prior cumulative anthracycline exposure for the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Administer prophylactic anti-emetics before treatment with VYXEOS. Table 1: Dose and Schedule for VYXEOS Cycle VYXEOS Dose and Schedule First Induction (daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2) liposome days 1, 3, and 5 Second Induction a (daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2) liposome days 1 and 3 Consolidation (daunorubicin 29 mg/m2 and cytarabine 65 mg/m2) liposome days 1 and 3 a Only for patients failing to achieve a response with the first induction cycle. For the first cycle of induction, the recommended dose of VYXEOS is (daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2) liposome administered via intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Prior to initiating induction, assess cardiac function and obtain liver and renal function studies. For patients who do not achieve remission with the first induction cycle, a second induction cycle may be administered 2 to 5 weeks after the first if there was no unacceptable toxicity with VYXEOS. The recommended dose for the second induction cycle of VYXEOS is (daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2) liposome administered via intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Administer the first consolidation cycle 5 to 8 weeks after the start of the last induction. The recommended dose for each cycle of consolidation therapy is VYXEOS (daunorubicin 29 mg/m2 and cytarabine 65 mg/m2) liposome administered via intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Assess cardiac function, complete blood counts, liver and renal function before each consolidation cycle. Do not start VYXEOS consolidation until the absolute neutrophil count recovers to greater than 0.5 Gi/L and the platelet count recovers to greater than 50 Gi/L in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Administer the second consolidation cycle 5 to 8 weeks after the start of the first consolidation cycle in patients who do not show disease progression or unacceptable toxicity to VYXEOS. 2.2 Dosage Modification Missed Doses of VYXEOS If a planned dose of VYXEOS is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible and adjust the dosing schedule accordingly, maintaining the treatment interval. Hypersensitivity Reactions For hypersensitivity reactions of any grade/severity, interrupt VYXEOS infusion immediately and manage symptoms. Reduce the rate of infusion or discontinue treatment as outlined below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Mild symptoms: Once symptoms resolve, reinitiate infusion at half the prior rate of infusion. Consider premedication with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids for subsequent doses of VYXEOS. Moderate symptoms: Do not reinitiate infusion. For subsequent doses of VYXEOS, premedicate with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids prior to initiating infusion at same rate. Severe/life-threatening symptoms: Permanently discontinue VYXEOS treatment, treat according to the standard of care to manage symptoms, and monitor patient until symptoms resolve. Cardiotoxicity Discontinue VYXEOS in patients who exhibit impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of continuing treatment outweighs the risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.3 Preparation and Handling Instructions VYXEOS is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.1 VYXEOS is supplied as a single-dose vial and does not contain any preservatives. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. Preparation Instructions: Calculate the VYXEOS dose based on daunorubicin and individual patient's BSA. Calculate the number of vials of VYXEOS based on the daunorubicin dose. Remove the appropriate number of vials of VYXEOS from the refrigerator and equilibrate to the room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, reconstitute each vial with 19 mL of Sterile Water for Injection using a sterile syringe and immediately thereafter start a 5-minute timer. Carefully swirl the contents of the vial for 5 minutes while gently inverting the vial every 30 seconds. Do not heat, vortex, or shake vigorously. After reconstitution, let rest for 15 minutes. The reconstituted product should be an opaque, purple, homogeneous dispersion, essentially free from visible particulates. After reconstitution (but before final dilution), each mL will contain 2.2 mg of daunorubicin and 5 mg of cytarabine. Gently invert each vial 5 times prior to withdrawing the reconstituted product for further dilution. If the reconstituted product is not diluted into an infusion bag immediately, store in refrigerator at 2C to 8C for up to 4 hours. Calculate the volume of reconstituted VYXEOS required using the following formula: [volume required (mL) = dose of daunorubicin (mg/m2) X patient's BSA (m2) 2.2 (mg/mL)] Aseptically withdraw the calculated volume of the reconstituted product from the vial(s) with a sterile syringe and transfer it to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. There may be residual product remaining in the vial. Discard unused portion. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The dilution of the reconstituted product results in a deep purple, translucent, homogeneous dispersion, free from visible particulates. If the diluted infusion solution is not used immediately, store in refrigerator at 2C to 8C for up to 4 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Only solutions without visible particles should be used. 2.4 Administration Instructions For intravenous use only. Do not mix VYXEOS with or administer as an infusion with other drugs. Administer VYXEOS by constant intravenous infusion over 90 minutes via an infusion pump through a central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter. Do not use an in-line filter. Flush the line after administration with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.","activeIngredient":3117138},{"uuid":"55150-203","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, POWDER, LYOPHILIZED, FOR SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Vancomycin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"AuroMedics Pharma LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant (-lactam-resistant) staphylococci. It is indicated for penicillin-allergic patients, for patients who cannot receive or who have failed to respond to other drugs, including the penicillins or cephalosporins, and for infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible organisms that are resistant to other antimicrobial drugs.Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is indicated for initial therapy when methicillin-resistant staphylococci are suspected, but after susceptibility data are available, therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is effective in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis. Its effectiveness has been documented in other infections due to staphylococci, including septicemia, bone infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections. When staphylococcal infections are localized and purulent, antibiotics are used as adjuncts to appropriate surgical measures. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection has been reported to be effective alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside for endocarditis caused by S. viridans or S. bovis. For endocarditis caused by enterococci (e.g., E. faecalis), vancomycin has been reported to be effective only in combination with an aminoglycoside. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection has been reported to be effective for the treatment of diphtheroid endocarditis. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection has been used successfully in combination with either rifampin, an aminoglycoside, or both in early-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis or diphtheroids. Specimens for bacteriologic cultures should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to vancomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness ofVancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. The parenteral form of vancomycin hydrochloride may be administered orally for treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis. Parenteral administration of vancomycin hydrochloride alone is of unproven benefit for these indications. Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of infections.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to this antibiotic.","howSupplied":"HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is a white or off-white to light tan lyophilized powder or cake and is supplied as follows: NDC No. 55150-203-10 Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP equivalent to 500 mg vancomycin in a flip-top vial, in packages of 10. 55150-204-20 Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP equivalent to 1 g vancomycin in a flip-top vial, in packages of 10.

Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (red neck) or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes. In studies of normal volunteers, infusion-related events did not occur when vancomycin hydrochloride for injection was administered at a rate of 10 mg/min or less. Nephrotoxicity Systemic vancomycin exposure may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). The risk of AKI increases as systemic exposure/serum levels increase. Additional risk factors for AKI in patients receiving vancomycin include receipt of concomitant drugs known to be nephrotoxic, in patients with pre-exiting renal impairment, or with co-morbidities that predispose to renal impairment. Interstitial nephritis has also been reported in patients receiving vancomycin. Gastrointestinal Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS ). Ototoxicity A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a causal relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes <500/mm3) has been reported rarely. Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported. Miscellaneous Infrequently, patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, eosinophilia, rashes including exfoliative dermatitis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration (see PRECAUTIONS ) POST MARKETING REPORTS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS, contact AuroMedics Pharma LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov.","drugClass":"vancomycin","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infusion-related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and rates of no more than 10 mg/min, are recommended in adults (see also age-specific recommendations). In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg/mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related events. An infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Infusion-related events may occur, however, at any rate or concentration. Patients With Normal Renal Function Adults The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 60 minutes, whichever is longer. Other patient factors, such as age or obesity, may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose. Pediatric patients The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients. Neonates In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month, the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower. In neonates, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg is suggested, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1st week of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month. Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes. In premature infants, vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases. Therefore, longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients. Patients With Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In premature infants and the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography. If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min (see following table). DOSAGE TABLE FOR VANCOMYCIN IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION (Adapted from Moellering et al.4) Creatinine Clearance mL/min Vancomycin Dose mg/24 h 100 1,545 90 1,390 80 1,235 70 1,080 60 925 50 770 40 620 30 465 20 310 10 155 The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 hr. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended. When only serum creatinine is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly. Men: [Weight (kg) x (140 age in years)] 72 x serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL) Women: 0.85 x above value The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as in obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) routes have not been established. Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration. Compatibility with Other Drugs and IV Fluids The following diluents are physically and chemically compatible (with 4 g/L vancomycin hydrochloride): 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Lactated Ringers Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and Lactated Ringers Injection Normosol-M and 5% Dextrose 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Isolyte E Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible. Vancomycin solution has a low pH and may cause physical instability of other compounds. Preparation and Stability At the time of use, reconstitute the vials of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of 50 mg of vancomycin/mL (see following table for volume of diluent). Concentration/Vial Volume of Diluent 500 mg 10 mL 1 g 20 mL After reconstitution, the vials may be stored in a refrigerator for 14 days without significant loss of potency. Reconstituted solutions of vancomycin (500 mg/10 mL) must be further diluted in at least 100 mL of a suitable infusion solution. For doses of 1 gram (20 mL), at least 200 mL of solution must be used. The desired dose diluted in this manner should be administered by intermittent IV infusion over a period of at least 60 minutes. Compatibility with Intravenous Fluids Solutions that are diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may be stored in a refrigerator for 14 days without significant loss of potency. Solutions that are diluted with the following infusion fluids may be stored in a refrigerator for 96 hours: 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP Lactated Ringers Injection USP Lactated Ringers and 5% Dextrose Injection USP Normosol-M and 5% Dextrose Isolyte E Acetated Ringers Injection Vancomycin solution has a low pH and may cause chemical or physical instability when it is mixed with other compounds. Mixtures of solutions of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics have been shown to be physically incompatible. The likelihood of precipitation increases with higher concentrations of vancomycin. It is recommended to adequately flush the intravenous lines between the administration of these antibiotics. It is also recommended to dilute solutions of vancomycin to 5mg/mL or less. Although intravitreal injection is not an approved route of administration for vancomycin, precipitation has been reported after intravitreal injection of vancomycin and ceftazidime for endophthalmitis using different syringes and needles. The precipitates dissolved gradually, with complete clearing of the vitreous cavity over two months and with improvement of visual acuity. Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Oral Administration Oral vancomycin is used in treating antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis. Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of infections. The usual adult total daily dosage is 500 mg to 2 g given in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dose in children is 40 mg/kg of body weight in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dosage should not exceed 2 g. The appropriate dose may be diluted in 1 oz of water and given to the patients to drink. Common flavoring syrups may be added to the solution to improve the taste for oral administration. The diluted solution may be administered via a nasogastric tube.","activeIngredient":3059555},{"uuid":"52533-071","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":false,"nameDrug":"Vancomycin HCl","proprietaryName":"Cantrell Drug Company","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":null,"warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"vancomycin","maximumDoseSchedule":null,"activeIngredient":3071621},{"uuid":"51991-940","administrationRoute":"INTRAVENOUS","dosageForm":"INJECTION, SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Vancomycin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant (-lactam-resistant) staphylococci.

Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is indicated for initial therapy when methicillin-resistant staphylococci are suspected, but after susceptibility data are available, therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is effective in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis. Its effectiveness has been documented in other infections due to staphylococci, including septicemia, bone infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections.

Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (\"red neck\") or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes. In studies of normal volunteers, infusion-related events did not occur when vancomycin hydrochloride for injection was administered at a rate of 10 mg/min or less. Nephrotoxicity Systemic vancomycin exposure may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). The risk of AKI increases as systemic exposure/serum levels increase. Additional risk factors for AKI in patients receiving vancomycin include receipt of concomitant drugs known to be nephrotoxic, in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, or with co-morbidities that predispose to renal impairment. Interstitial nephritis has also been reported in patients receiving vancomycin. Gastrointestinal Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS ). Ototoxicity A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a causal relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes <500/mm3) has been reported rarely. Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported. Miscellaneous Infrequently, patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, eosinophilia, rashes including exfoliative dermatitis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration (see PRECAUTIONS ).","drugClass":"vancomycin","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infusion-related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and rates of no more than 10 mg/min, are recommended in adults (see also age-specific recommendations). In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg/mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related events. An infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Infusion-related events may occur, however, at any rate or concentration. Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 60 minutes, whichever is longer. Other patient factors, such as age or obesity, may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose. Pediatric patients The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients. Neonates In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month, the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower. In neonates, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg is suggested, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1st week of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month. Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes. In premature infants, vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases. Therefore, longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients. Patients with Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In premature infants and the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography. If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min (see following table). DOSAGE TABLE FOR VANCOMYCIN IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION (Adapted from Moellering et al.4) Creatinine Clearance mL/min Vancomycin Dose mg/24 h 100 1,545 90 1,390 80 1,235 70 1,080 60 925 50 770 40 620 30 465 20 310 10 155 The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 hr. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended. When only serum creatinine is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly. Men: [Weight (kg) (140 age in years)] 72 serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL) Women: 0.85 above value The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as in obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) routes have not been established. Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration.

PREPARATION AND STABILITY Directions for Proper Use of a Pharmacy Bulk Package DIRECTIONS FOR PROPER USE OF PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE Not for direct infusion. The pharmacy bulk package is for use in the Pharmacy Admixture Service only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood. Using aseptic technique, the closure may be penetrated only one time after reconstitution using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set, which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. After entry use entire contents of the Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle promptly. The entire contents of the Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle should be dispensed within 4 hours after initial entry. A maximum time of 4 hours from the initial entry may be allowed to complete fluid aliquoting/transferring operations. Discard the container no later than 4 hours after initial closure puncture. This time limit should begin with the introduction of solvent or diluent into the Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle. Preparation and Stability 10 g Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle At the time of use, reconstitute by adding 95 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP to the 10 g bottle of dry, sterile vancomycin powder. The resultant solution will contain vancomycin equivalent to 500 mg/5 mL (1 g/10 mL). AFTER RECONSTITUTION, FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED. Reconstituted solutions of vancomycin (500 mg/5 mL) must be further diluted in at least 100 mL of a suitable infusion solution. For doses of 1 gram (10 mL), at least 200 mL of solution must be used. The desired dose diluted in this manner should be administered by intermittent IV infusion over a period of at least 60 minutes.

(1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock. (5.7) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.8) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets contain morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, morphine sulfate extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Because extended-release products such as morphine sulfate extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, and monitor all patients receiving morphine sulfate extended-release tablets for development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks of proper use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression especially within the first 24 to72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the morphine sulfate extended-release tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating morphine sulfate extended-release tablets and when morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.6 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The morphine in morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The morphine in morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during morphine sulfate extended-release tablets therapy. 5.12Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)]. When discontinuing morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release tablets [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [seePatient Counseling Information (17)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)] Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5)] Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6),Drug Interactions (7)].

Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most Frequently Observed Reactions In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets were constipation, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dysphoria, and euphoric mood. Some of these effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Reactions Cardiovascular disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: visual impairment, vision blurred, diplopia, miosis Gastrointestinal disorders: dry mouth, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia General disorders and administration site conditions: chills, feeling abnormal, edema, edema peripheral, weakness Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity, muscle twitching Nervous system disorders: presyncope, syncope, headache, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, convulsion, intracranial pressure increased, taste alteration, paresthesia, nystagmus Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, anxiety, depression, abnormal dreams, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Reproductive system and breast disorders: reduced libido and/or potency Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritus, urticaria, rash Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Amenorrhea, asthenia, bronchospasm, confusional state, drug hypersensitivity, fatigue, hyperalgesia, hypertonia, ileus, increased hepatic enzymes, intestinal obstruction, lethargy, malaise, pulmonary edema, thinking disturbances, somnolence, and vertigo. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].","drugClass":"morphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To be prescribed only by healthcare providers knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for management of chronic pain. (2.1) Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets 100 mg and 200 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. (2.1) Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) Instruct patients to swallow morphine sulfate extended-release tablets intact and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve morphine sulfate extended-release tablets to avoid the risk of release and absorption of potential fatal dose of morphine. (2.1, 5.1) For opioid-nave and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 15 mg tablets orally every 8 to 12 hours. (2.2) Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets 100 mg and 200 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone daily, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [seeWarnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct patients to swallow morphine sulfate extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving morphine sulfate extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are administered orally once every 8 or 12 hours. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-nave patients) Initiate treatment with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets with 15 mg tablets orally every 8 or 12 hours. Use of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant (opioid non-tolerant patients) The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is morphine sulfate extended-release tablets 15 mg orally every 12 hours. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from Other Oral Morphine to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets Patients receiving other oral morphine formulations may be converted to morphine sulfate extended-release tablets by administering one-half of the patient's 24-hour requirement as morphine sulfate extended-release tablets on an every-12-hour schedule or by administering one-third of the patient's daily requirement as morphine sulfate extended-release tablets on an every-8-hour schedule. Conversion from Other Opioids to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when morphine sulfate extended-release tablets therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to morphine sulfate extended-release tablets defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using morphine sulfate extended-release tablets 15 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24-hour oral morphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to morphine sulfate extended-release tablets. Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Opioids (Parenteral or Oral) to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets When converting from parenteral morphine or other non-morphine opioids (parenteral or oral) to morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, consider the following general points: Parenteral to oral morphine ratio: Between 2 to 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Typically, a dose of morphine that is approximately three times the previous daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient. Other parenteral or oral non-morphine opioids to oral morphine ratios: Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily morphine requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediate-release morphine. Conversion from Methadone to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. 2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate morphine sulfate extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving morphine sulfate extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the morphine sulfate extended-release tablets dosage. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, morphine sulfate extended-release tablets dosage adjustments may be done every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.4 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and the decision is made to begin morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, start with the lowest possible dose, 15 mg every12 hours, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension, and consider using a lower dosage of the concomitant CNS depressant [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets When a patient no longer requires therapy with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].","activeIngredient":3098765},{"uuid":"60793-430","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"CAPSULE, EXTENDED RELEASE","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"EMBEDA","proprietaryName":"Pfizer Laboratories Div Pfizer Inc","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE EMBEDA is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

(5.7) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of EMBEDA in patients with circulatory shock. (5.8) Risk of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.9) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse EMBEDA contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, EMBEDA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Because extended-release products such as EMBEDA deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed EMBEDA. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing EMBEDA, and monitor all patients receiving EMBEDA for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as EMBEDA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of EMBEDA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of EMBEDA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the morphine and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Misuse or abuse of EMBEDA by these methods may also release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing EMBEDA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of EMBEDA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression especially during the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of EMBEDA. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of EMBEDA are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the EMBEDA dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of EMBEDA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of EMBEDA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of EMBEDA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when EMBEDA is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of EMBEDA in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with chronic pulmonary disease: EMBEDA-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of EMBEDA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml]. </paragraph Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating EMBEDA and when EMBEDA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2</linkHtml, 5.4)</linkHtml]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. </paragraph </text </section </component </section </component 5.6 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. EMBEDA should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension EMBEDA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of EMBEDA. In patients with circulatory shock, EMBEDA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), EMBEDA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with EMBEDA. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions EMBEDA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The morphine in EMBEDA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The morphine in EMBEDA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during EMBEDA therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including EMBEDA. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Consuming EMBEDA capsules that have been altered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal usually appear within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone, can last for up to 48 hours, and can include mental status changes, restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea can require intravenous (IV) fluid administration. When discontinuing EMBEDA, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Do not abruptly discontinue EMBEDA [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery EMBEDA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of EMBEDA and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.14 Interference with Laboratory Tests Naltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high performance liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone, or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Consult the test manufacturer for specific details.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS EMBEDA is contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to morphine or naltrexone [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Significant respiratory depression (4) Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment (4) Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days (5.6) Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus (4) Hypersensitivity to morphine or naltrexone (4)","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING EMBEDA 20 mg/0.8 mg EMBEDA 30 mg/1.2 mg EMBEDA 50 mg/2 mg EMBEDA 60 mg/2.4 mg EMBEDA 80 mg/3.2 mg EMBEDA 100 mg/4 mg Morphine sulfate 20 mg 30 mg 50 mg 60 mg 80 mg 100 mg Sequestered naltrexone hydrochloride 0.8 mg 1.2 mg 2 mg 2.4 mg 3.2 mg 4 mg Extended-Release Capsule Description For all strengths, the darker-toned cap has \"EMBEDA\" printed in grey ink and a single grey band around of the circumference.

In the randomized study, the most common adverse reactions with EMBEDA therapy were constipation, nausea, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, constipation (sometimes severe), vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, pruritus, and somnolence. Short-Term Randomized Study This study utilized an enriched enrollment with a randomized withdrawal design in which subjects were titrated to effect on open-label EMBEDA for up to 45 days. Once their pain was controlled, 344 of 547 subjects were randomized to either an active treatment with EMBEDA or were tapered off EMBEDA using a double-dummy design and placed on placebo. The maintenance Period was 12 weeks. Adverse reactions, reported in 2% of subjects in either the titration or maintenance phase of the 12-week study are presented in Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in EMBEDA. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].","drugClass":"morphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To be prescribed only by healthcare providers knowledgeable in use of potent opioids for management of chronic pain. (2.1) EMBEDA 100 mg/4 mg capsules, a single dose greater than 60 mg/2.4 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg/5 mg are only for patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency is established. (2.1) Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. (2.1) Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA capsules intact, or to sprinkle the capsule contents on applesauce and immediately swallow without chewing. (2.1) Instruct patients not to cut, break, crush, dissolve, or chew the pellets in the capsule to avoid the risk of release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine, and to avoid release of sequestered naltrexone that could precipitate opioid withdrawal. (2.1, 5.1) For opioid-nave and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 20 mg/0.8 mg capsules (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) orally every 24 hours. (2.2) Do not abruptly discontinue EMBEDA in a physically dependent patient. (2.5, 5.12) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions EMBEDA should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. EMBEDA 100 mg/4 mg capsules, a single dose greater than 60 mg/2.4 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg/5 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency is established. Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually; taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with EMBEDA and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA capsules whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving EMBEDA capsules will result in uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instruct patients who are unable to swallow EMBEDA to sprinkle the capsule contents on applesauce and immediately swallow without chewing [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. EMBEDA is administered orally at a frequency of either once daily (every 24 hours) or twice daily (every 12 hours). 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of EMBEDA as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid naive patients) Initiate treatment with EMBEDA with 20 mg/0.8 mg capsule orally every 24 hours. Use of EMBEDA in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant (opioid-non-tolerant patients) The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is EMBEDA 20 mg/0.8 mg orally every 24 hours. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Conversion from Other Opioids to EMBEDA Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when EMBEDA therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios from other opioids to EMBEDA defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using EMBEDA 30 mg orally every 24 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral morphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release morphine) than to overestimate the 24-hour morphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While there are useful tables of opioid equivalents readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the relative potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of over sedation/toxicity after converting patients to EMBEDA. Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to EMBEDA Patients receiving other oral morphine formulations may be converted to EMBEDA by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as EMBEDA twice daily, or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose as EMBEDA once daily. There are no data to support the efficacy or safety of prescribing EMBEDA more frequently than every 12 hours. Conversion from Parenteral Morphine, or Other Opioids, to EMBEDA When converting from parenteral morphine or other non-morphine opioids (parenteral or oral) to EMBEDA, consider the following general points: Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: Between 2 mg and 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Typically, a dose of oral morphine that is three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient. Other Oral or Parenteral Opioids to Oral Morphine Ratios: Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily morphine requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediate-release morphine. Conversion from Methadone to EMBEDA Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. The first dose of EMBEDA may be taken with the last dose of any immediate-release opioid medication due to the extended-release characteristics of the EMBEDA formulation. 2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate EMBEDA to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving EMBEDA to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of EMBEDA, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the EMBEDA dosage. In patients experiencing inadequate analgesia with once-daily dosing of EMBEDA, consider a twice-daily regimen. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, EMBEDA dose may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.4 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and the decision is made to begin EMBEDA, start with 1/3 to 1/2 the recommended starting dosage of EMBEDA, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension, and consider using a lower dosage of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. 2.5 Discontinuation of EMBEDA When a patient no longer requires therapy with EMBEDA, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue EMBEDA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 2.6 Administration of EMBEDA Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA capsules intact. The capsules contain pellets that consist of morphine and sequestered naltrexone. The pellets in the capsules are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consuming EMBEDA capsules that have been altered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Alternatively, the contents of the EMBEDA capsules (pellets) may be sprinkled over applesauce and then swallowed. This method is appropriate only for patients able to reliably swallow the applesauce without chewing. Other foods have not been tested and should not be substituted for applesauce. Instruct the patient to: Sprinkle the pellets onto a small amount of applesauce and consume immediately without chewing. Rinse the mouth to ensure all pellets have been swallowed. Discard any unused portion of the EMBEDA capsules after the contents have been sprinkled on applesauce. Do not administer EMBEDA pellets through a nasogastric or gastric tube.","activeIngredient":3120444},{"uuid":"70408-358","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution","proprietaryName":"Nostrum Laboratories, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Morphine sulfate oral solution (10 mg per 5 mL and 20 mg per 5 mL) are formulations of morphine, an opioid agonist, indicated for the relief of moderate to severe acute and chronic pain where use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.

(5.1) Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction. (5.2) Controlled substance: Morphine sulfate is a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioids. (5.3) CNS effects: Additive CNS depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.4) Elevation of intracranial pressure: May be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions. (5.5) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: In patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.7) Sphincter of Oddi spasm and diminished biliary/pancreatic secretions. Increased risk with biliary tract disease. (5.8) Special Risk Groups: Use with caution and in reduced dosages in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, Addisons disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, elderly, CNS depression, toxic psychosis, acute alcoholism and delirium tremens, may aggravate or induce seizures. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Morphine sulfate oral solution is available in 10 mg per 5 mL and 20 mg per 5 mL concentrations. Use caution when prescribing, dispensing, and administering morphine sulfate oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Use caution to ensure the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the primary risk of morphine sulfate. Respiratory depression occurs more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction, in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation. Use morphine sulfate with extreme caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve (e.g., severe kyphoscoliosis), hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of morphine sulfate may increase airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics, and use morphine sulfate only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.3 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Morphine sulfate is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to criminal penalty. Morphine sulfate can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing morphine sulfate in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Morphine sulfate may be abused by inhaling or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death. [See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)] Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.4 Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Morphine sulfate may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression because respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death may result. 5.5 Use In Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of morphine sulfate and its potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, morphine sulfate can produce effects on pupillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. 5.6 Hypotensive Effects Morphine sulfate may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a depleted blood volume or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics. Morphine sulfate may produce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. Administer morphine sulfate with caution to patients in circulatory shock, as vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.7 Gastrointestinal Effects Do not administer morphine sulfate to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus because morphine sulfate diminishes propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and may prolong the obstruction. The administration of morphine sulfate may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal condition. 5.8 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Use morphine sulfate with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, as morphine sulfate may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions. 5.9 Special Risk Groups Use morphine sulfate with caution and in reduced dosages in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, Addisons disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, and in elderly or debilitated patients. [See USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)] Exercise caution in the administration of morphine sulfate to patients with CNS depression, toxic psychosis, acute alcoholism and delirium tremens. All opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Keep morphine sulfate oral solution out of the reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, seek emergency medical help immediately. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Caution patients that morphine sulfate could impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients about the potential combined effects of morphine sulfate with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, phenothiazines, sedative/hypnotics and alcohol.

The common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy with morphine sulfate are dose-dependent and are typical opioid-related side effects. The most frequent of these include constipation, nausea, and somnolence. Other commonly observed adverse reactions include: lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, vomiting, and sweating. The frequency of these events depends upon several factors including clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. Anticipate and manage these events as part of opioid analgesia therapy. Other less frequently observed adverse reactions expected from opioid analgesics, including morphine sulfate include: Body as a Whole: malaise, withdrawal syndrome Cardiovascular System: bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: anorexia, biliary pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, gastroenteritis, abnormal liver function tests, rectal disorder, thirst Endocrine: hypogonadism Hemic and Lymphatic System: anemia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: edema, weight loss Musculoskeletal: skeletal muscle rigidity, decreased bone mineral density Nervous System: abnormal dreams, abnormal gait, agitation, amnesia, anxiety, ataxia, confusion, convulsions, coma, delirium, depression, dry mouth, euphoria, hallucinations, lethargy, nervousness, abnormal thinking, tremor, vasodilation, vertigo, headache Respiratory System: hiccup, hypoventilation, voice alteration Skin and Appendages: dry skin, urticaria, pruritus Special Senses: amblyopia, eye pain, taste perversion Urogenital System: abnormal ejaculation, dysuria, impotence, decreased libido, oliguria, urinary retention or hesitancy,antidiuretic effect, amenorrhea Most common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy are: constipation, nausea, somnolence, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, vomiting, and sweating.

Take care when prescribing and administering morphine sulfate oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Take care to ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and total dose in volume. Selection of patients for treatment with morphine sulfate should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics. Individualize treatment in every case, using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis and/or combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society. Morphine sulfate oral solution: 10 to 20 mg every 4 hours as needed. (2.2) 2.1 Individualization of Dosage As with any opioid drug product, adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of morphine sulfate, give attention to the following: the total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously; the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent morphine sulfate dose needed; the patients degree of opioid tolerance; the general condition and medical status of the patient; concurrent medications; the type and severity of the patients pain; risk factors for abuse, addiction or diversion, including a prior history of abuse, addiction or diversion. The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient. Continual reevaluation of the patient receiving morphine sulfate is important, with special attention to the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of side effects associated with therapy. During chronic therapy, especially for non-cancer-related pain, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. 2.2 Initiation of Therapy in Opioid-Nave Patients Start patients who have not been receiving opioid analgesics on morphine sulfate in the following dosing range using Oral Solution, 10 mg per 5 mL or 20 mg per 5 mL strengths: Morphine sulfate oral solution: 10 to 20 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patients response to their initial dose of morphine sulfate. Adjust the dose to an acceptable level of analgesia taking into account the improvement in pain intensity and the tolerability of the morphine by the patient. 2.3 Conversion to Oral Morphine Sulfate There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dose of morphine sulfate. It isbetter to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral morphine sulfate dose and make available rescue medication than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine sulfate dose and manage an adverse experience of overdose. Consider the following general points regarding opioid conversions. Conversion From Parenteral Morphine to Oral Morphine Sulfate For conversion from parenteral to oral morphine sulfate, anywhere from 3 to 6 mg of oral morphine sulfate may be required to provide pain relief equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Conversion From Parenteral Oral Non-Morphine Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate In converting patients from other opioids to morphine sulfate, close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patients response to morphine sulfate is imperative. Physicians and other healthcare professionals are advised to refer to published relative potency information, keeping in mind that conversion ratios are only approximate. Conversion From Controlled-Release Oral Morphine to Oral Morphine Sulfate For a given dose, the same total amount of morphine sulfate is available from morphine sulfate oral solution, morphine sulfate tablets, and controlled-release and extended-release morphine capsules. The extended duration of release of morphine sulfate from controlled-release tablets or extended-release tablets results in reduced maximum and increased minimum plasma morphine sulfate concentrations than with shorter acting morphine sulfate products. Conversion from oral solution or immediate-release tablets to the same total daily dose of controlled-release tablets or extended-release tablets could lead to excessive sedation at peak serum levels. Therefore, dosage adjustment with close observation is necessary. 2.4 Maintenance of Therapy Continual reevaluation of the patient receiving morphine sulfate is important, with special attention to the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of side effects associated with therapy. If the level of pain increases, effort should be made to identify the source of increased pain, while adjusting the dose as described above to decrease the level of pain. During chronic therapy, especially for non-cancer-related pain (or pain associated with other terminal illnesses), periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. 2.5 Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with morphine sulfate, gradually taper the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient.","activeIngredient":3058219},{"uuid":"62559-153","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"SOLUTION","isAvailableGenerally":false,"nameDrug":"Opium Tincture Deodorized","proprietaryName":"ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Opium tincture is useful for the treatment of diarrhea.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS This preparation is not recommended for use in children.

The relationship to therapy with Ranitidine Oral Solution has been unclear in many cases. Headache, sometimes severe, seems to be related to administration of Ranitidine Oral Solution. Central Nervous System: Rarely, malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. Rare cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported, predominantly in severely ill elderly patients. Rare cases of reversible blurred vision suggestive of a change in accommodation have been reported. Rare reports of reversible involuntary motor disturbances have been received. Cardiovascular: As with other H2-blockers, rare reports of arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats. Gastrointestinal: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort/pain, and rare reports of pancreatitis. Hepatic: There have been occasional reports of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis, with or without jaundice. In such circumstances, ranitidine should be immediately discontinued. These events are usually reversible, but in rare circumstances death has occurred. Rare cases of hepatic failure have also been reported. In normal volunteers, SGPT values were increased to at least twice the pretreatment levels in 6 of 12 subjects receiving 100 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 7 days, and in 4 of 24 subjects receiving 50 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 5 days. Musculoskeletal: Rare reports of arthralgias and myalgias. Hematologic: Blood count changes (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia) have occurred in a few patients. These were usually reversible. Rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, sometimes with marrow hypoplasia, and aplastic anemia and exceedingly rare cases of acquired immune hemolytic anemia have been reported. Endocrine: Controlled studies in animals and man have shown no stimulation of any pituitary hormone by ranitidine hydrochloride and no antiandrogenic activity, and cimetidine-induced gynecomastia and impotence in hypersecretory patients have resolved when Ranitidine Oral Solution has been substituted. However, occasional cases of impotence and loss of libido have been reported in male patients receiving Ranitidine Oral Solution, but the incidence did not differ from that in the general population. Rare cases of breast symptoms and conditions, including galactorrhea and gynecomastia, have been reported in both males and females. Integumentary: Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme. Rare cases of alopecia and vasculitis. Respiratory: A large epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of developing pneumonia in current users of histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) compared to patients who had stopped H2RA treatment, with an observed adjusted relative risk of 1.63 (95% Cl, 1.07 to 2.48). However, a causal relationship between use of H2RAs and pneumonia has not been established. Other: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., bronchospasm, fever, rash, eosinophilia), anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, acute interstitial nephritis and small increases in serum creatinine.","drugClass":"ranitidine","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Active Duodenal Ulcer The current recommended adult dosage of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP for duodenal ulcer is 150 mg or 10 mL of oral solution (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) twice daily. An alternative dosage of 300 mg or 20 mL of oral solution (4 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 300 mg of ranitidine) once daily after the evening meal or at bedtime can be used for patients in whom dosing convenience is important. The advantages of one treatment regimen compared to the other in a particular patient population have yet to be demonstrated (see Clinical Trials: Active Duodenal Ulcer). Smaller doses have been shown to be equally effective in inhibiting gastric acid secretion in US studies, and several foreign trials have shown that 100 mg twice daily is as effective as the 150-mg dose. Antacid should be given as needed for relief of pain (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). Maintenance of Healing of Duodenal Ulcers The current recommended adult dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) at bedtime. Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) The current recommended adult dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) twice daily. In some patients it may be necessary to administer Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP 150-mg doses more frequently. Dosages should be adjusted to individual patient needs, and should continue as long as clinically indicated. Dosages up to 6 g/day have been employed in patients with severe disease. Benign Gastric Ulcer The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) twice daily. Maintenance of Healing of Gastric Ulcers The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) at bedtime. GERD The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) twice daily. Erosive Esophagitis The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) 4 times daily. Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) twice daily. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP have been established in the age-group of 1 month to 16 years. There is insufficient information about the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine hydrochloride, USP in neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) to make dosing recommendations. The following 3 subsections provide dosing information for each of the pediatric indications. Treatment of Duodenal and Gastric Ulcers The recommended oral dose for the treatment of active duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg twice daily to a maximum of 300 mg/day. This recommendation is derived from adult clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients. Maintenance of Healing of Duodenal and Gastric Ulcers The recommended oral dose for the maintenance of healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg once daily to a maximum of 150 mg/day. This recommendation is derived from adult clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients. Treatment of GERD and Erosive Esophagitis Although limited data exist for these conditions in pediatric patients, published literature supports a dosage of 5 to 10 mg/kg/day, usually given as 2 divided doses. Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Impaired Renal Function On the basis of experience with a group of subjects with severely impaired renal function treated with ranitidine hydrochloride USP, the recommended dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min is 150 mg or 10 mL of Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP (2 teaspoonfuls of solution equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine) every 24 hours. Should the patient's condition require, the frequency of dosing may be increased to every 12 hours or even further with caution. Hemodialysis reduces the level of circulating ranitidine. Ideally, the dosing schedule should be adjusted so that the timing of a scheduled dose coincides with the end of hemodialysis. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics: Geriatrics and PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).","activeIngredient":3093257},{"uuid":"69168-375","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Ranitidine 150","proprietaryName":"Allegiant Health","hasPrescription":false,"descriptionDrug":"Uses relieves heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach prevents heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach brought on by certain foods and beverages","warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"ranitidine","maximumDoseSchedule":"Directions adults and children 12 years of age and over: to relieve symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water to prevent symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water 30 to 60 minutes before eating food or drinking beverages that cause heartburn can be used up to twice daily (do not take more than 2 tablets in 24 hours) children under 12 years: ask a doctor","activeIngredient":3207944},{"uuid":"59088-062","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"DermacinRx Inflammatral Pak","proprietaryName":"PureTek Corporation","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":null,"warning":null,"contraindication":null,"howSupplied":null,"adverseReaction":null,"drugClass":"diclofenac","maximumDoseSchedule":null,"activeIngredient":3092192},{"uuid":"68405-033","administrationRoute":null,"dosageForm":"KIT","isAvailableGenerally":false,"nameDrug":"Sentradine","proprietaryName":"Physician Therapeutics LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS FOR USE Sentra PM is intended for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes associated with sleep disorders.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Ranitidine tablets USP are contraindicated for patients known to have hypersensitivity to the drug or any of the ingredients (see PRECAUTIONS ).","howSupplied":"How Supplied Sentra PM is supplied in red and white, size 0 capsules in bottles of 60 capsules.

Dosage of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in adults is 2000 mg. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should generally be given once daily with the evening meal. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass. (See Patient information printed below.) Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults - In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal. If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2000 mg once daily, a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily should be considered. In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.) If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response. Specific Patient Populations Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet is not recommended in pediatric patients (below the age of 17 years). The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.","activeIngredient":3102039},{"uuid":"23155-233","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Glyburide-Metformin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2) (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ).

Edema was reported in 7.7% (14/181) of patients treated with rosiglitazone compared to 2.2% (4/184) of patients treated with placebo. A mean weight gain of 3 kg was observed in rosiglitazone-treated patients. Disulfiram-like reactions have very rarely been reported in patients treated with glyburide tablets. Hypoglycemia In controlled clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride there were no hypoglycemic episodes requiring medical intervention and/or pharmacologic therapy; all events were managed by the patients. The incidence of reported symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as dizziness, shakiness, sweating, and hunger), in the initial therapy trial of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride are summarized in Table 7 . The frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms in patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25 mg/250 mg was highest in patients with a baseline HbA1c 8%. For patients with a baseline HbA1c between 8% and 11% treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride2.5 mg/500 mg as initial therapy, the frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms was 30% to 35%. As second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea alone, approximately 6.8% of all patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochlorideexperienced hypoglycemic symptoms. When rosiglitazone was added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloridetherapy, 22% of patients reported 1 or more fingerstick glucose measurements 50 mg/dL compared to 3.3% of placebo-treated patients. All hypoglycemic events were managed by the patients and only 1 patient discontinued for hypoglycemia. (See PRECAUTIONS: General: Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Therapy .) Gastrointestinal Reactions The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain) in the initial therapy trial are summarized in Table 7 . Across all glyburide and metformin hydrochloride trials, GI symptoms were the most common adverse events with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and were more frequent at higher dose levels. In controlled trials, <2% of patients discontinued glyburide and metformin hydrochloridetherapy due to GI adverse events.

Glyburide Gastrointestinal reactions Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progres to liver failure; the drug should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations, have been reported. Dermatological Reactions Allergic skin reactions, eg, pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform of maculopapular eruptions, occur in 1.5% of glyburide-treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactionos have been identified during post-approval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Allergic: Angioedema, arthralgia, myalgia, and vasculitis have been reported. Dermatologic: Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, which occasionally may present as purpura, hemolytic anemia, aplstic anemia, and pancytopenia, have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic: Hepatic porphyria reactions ahve been reported with sulfonylureas; however, these have not been reported with glyburide. Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely with glyburide. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas, most ofen in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. Other Reactions: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels.","drugClass":"glibenclamide","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations Dosage of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glyburide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), andpermit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy in patients taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. In Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals. For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochlorideis 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with baseline HbA1c >9% or an FPG >200 mg/dL, a starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every 2 weeks up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. In clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses >10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Use in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with meals. For patients not adequately controlled on either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should not exceed the daily doses of glyburide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day. For patients previously treated with combination therapy of glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin, if switched to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glyburide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Therapy For patients not adequately controlled on glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, a thiazolidinedione can be added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy. When a thiazolidinedione is added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy, the current dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride can be continued and the thiazolidinedione initiated at its recommended starting dose. For patients needing additional glycemic control, the dose of the thiazolidinedione can be increased based on its recommended titration schedule. The increased glycemic control attainable with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride plus a thiazolidinedione may increase the potential for hypoglycemia at any time of day. In patients who develop hypoglycemia when receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and a thiazolidinedione, consideration should be given to reducing the dose of the glyburide component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. As clinically warranted, adjustment of the dosages of the other components of the antidiabetic regimen should also be considered. Patients Receiving Colesevelam When colesevelam is coadministered with glyburide, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glyburide is reduced. Therefore, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride are contraindicated in patinets with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Initiation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloridein patients with aneGFR between 30-45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride if the patients's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Specific Patient Populations Glyburide and metformin hydrochlorideis not recommended for use during pregnancy. The initial and maintenance dosing of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function.","activeIngredient":3119236},{"uuid":"67877-561","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Metformin HCl","proprietaryName":"Ascend Laboratories, LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS & USAGE Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP are contraindicated in patients with: 1.

Dosage of metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age). Metformin hydrochloride should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin hydrochloride should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin hydrochloride may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals. If higher doses of metformin are required, metformin hydrochloride should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses, as described above. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies.) Pediatrics The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin hydrochloride, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin hydrochloride 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of metformin hydrochloride and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.) If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride therapy. Metformin hydrochloride therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for metformin hydrochloride. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response. Specific Patient Populations Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients below the age of 10 years. The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function.

Edema was reported in 7.7% (14/181) of patients treated with rosiglitazone compared to 2.2% (4/184) of patients treated with placebo. A mean weight gain of 3 kg was observed in rosiglitazone-treated patients. Disulfiram-like reactions have very rarely been reported in patients treated with glyburide tablets. Hypoglycemia In controlled clinical trials of glyburide and metformin there were no hypoglycemic episodes requiring medical intervention and/or pharmacologic therapy; all events were managed by the patients. The incidence of reported symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as dizziness, shakiness, sweating, and hunger), in the initial therapy trial of glyburide and metformin are summarized in Table 7. The frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms in patients treated with glyburide and metformin 1.25 mg/250 mg was highest in patients with a baseline HbA 1c < 7%, lower in those with a baseline HbA 1c of between 7% and 8%, and was comparable to placebo and metformin in those with a baseline HbA 1c > 8%. For patients with a baseline HbA 1c between 8% and 11% treated with glyburide and metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg as initial therapy, the frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms was 30 to 35%. As second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea alone, approximately 6.8% of all patients treated with glyburide and metformin experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. When rosiglitazone was added to glyburide and metformin therapy, 22% of patients reported one or more fingerstick glucose measurements 50 mg/dL compared to 3.3% of placebo-treated patients. All hypoglycemic events were managed by the patients and only one patient discontinued for hypoglycemia (see PRECAUTIONS, General, Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Therapy ). Gastrointestinal Reactions The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain) in the initial therapy trial are summarized in Table 7. Across all glyburide and metformin trials, GI symptoms were the most common adverse events with glyburide and metformin and were more frequent at higher dose levels. In controlled trials, < 2% of patients discontinued glyburide and metformin therapy due to GI adverse events.

Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glyburide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA 1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA 1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA 1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Use in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals. For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with baseline HbA 1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg/dL, a starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every two weeks up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. In clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses greater than 10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Use in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with meals. For patients not adequately controlled on either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glyburide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day. For patients previously treated with combination therapy of glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin, if switched to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glyburide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Therapy For patients not adequately controlled on glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, a thiazolidinedione can be added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy. When a thiazolidinedione is added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy, the current dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets can be continued and the thiazolidinedione initiated at its recommended starting dose. For patients needing additional glycemic control, the dose of the thiazolidinedione can be increased based on its recommended titration schedule. The increased glycemic control attainable with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets plus a thiazolidinedione may increase the potential for hypoglycemia at any time of day. In patients who develop hypoglycemia when receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and a thiazolidinedione, consideration should be given to reducing the dose of the glyburide component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. As clinically warranted, adjustment of the dosages of the other components of the antidiabetic regimen should also be considered. Patients Receiving Colesevelam When colesevelam is coadministered with glyburide, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glyburide is reduced. Therefore, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Specific Patient Populations Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy. The initial and maintenance dosing of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see WARNINGS).","activeIngredient":3064200},{"uuid":"0597-0146","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Jentadueto","proprietaryName":"Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1INDICATIONS AND USAGE JENTADUETO is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and biguanide combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate (1.1) Important limitations of use: Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (1.2) Has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis (1.2) 1.1 Indication JENTADUETO is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Important Limitations of Use JENTADUETO should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. JENTADUETO has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at an increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JENTADUETO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","warning":"5WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis: See boxed warning (5.1) There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JENTADUETO. (5.2) Heart Failure: Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JENTADUETO in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea (SU)) or insulin, consider lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (5.4) There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin (one of the components of JENTADUETO) including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. In such cases, promptly discontinue JENTADUETO, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.5) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.6) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (5.7) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JENTADUETO. (5.8) Macrovascular outcomes: No conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JENTADUETO (5.9) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis Metformin There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JENTADUETO. In JENTADUETO-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JENTADUETO and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patients renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: Before initiating JENTADUETO, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. Initiation of JENTADUETO is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JENTADUETO. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking JENTADUETO whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of JENTADUETO with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patients age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JENTADUETO at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JENTADUETO if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JENTADUETO should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JENTADUETO. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JENTADUETO. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JENTADUETO in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients taking linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JENTADUETO and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JENTADUETO. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JENTADUETO prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JENTADUETO. 5.4 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Linagliptin Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of linagliptin in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The use of linagliptin in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JENTADUETO [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Metformin Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as SUs and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking -adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin (one of the components of JENTADUETO). These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with linagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JENTADUETO, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JENTADUETO. 5.6 Vitamin B12</sub Levels In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (<1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin, and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on JENTADUETO and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful. 5.7 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.8 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JENTADUETO. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JENTADUETO should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with linagliptin or metformin.","contraindication":"4CONTRAINDICATIONS JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with: Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.

Linagliptin/Metformin The safety of concomitantly administered linagliptin (daily dose 5 mg) and metformin (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 2816 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 12 weeks in clinical trials. Three placebo-controlled studies with linagliptin + metformin were conducted: 2 studies were 24 weeks in duration, 1 study was 12 weeks in duration. In the 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies, adverse events which occurred in 5% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin (n=875) and were more common than in patients given placebo + metformin (n=539) included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 4.3%). In a 24-week factorial design study, adverse events reported in 5% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin and were more common than in patients given placebo are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in 5% of Patients Treated with Linagliptin + Metformin and Greater than with Placebo in a 24-week Factorial-Design Study Placebo n=72 Linagliptin Monotherapy n=142 Metformin Monotherapy n=291 Combination of Linagliptin with Metformin n=286 n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) Nasopharyngitis 1 (1.4) 8 (5.6) 8 (2.7) 18 (6.3) Diarrhea 2 (2.8) 5 (3.5) 11 (3.8) 18 (6.3) Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin + metformin were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, or bronchial hyperreactivity), cough, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and pancreatitis. Linagliptin Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included: nasopharyngitis (7.0% vs 6.1%), diarrhea (3.3% vs 3.0%), and cough (2.1% vs 1.4%). Rates for other adverse reactions for linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo when linagliptin was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were: urinary tract infection (3.1% vs 0%) and hypertriglyceridemia (2.4% vs 0%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to sulfonylurea; hyperlipidemia (2.7% vs 0.8%) and weight increased (2.3% vs 0.8%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin monotherapy were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin. Metformin The most common adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache. Hypoglycemia Linagliptin/Metformin In a 24-week factorial design study, hypoglycemia was reported in 4 (1.4%) of 286 subjects treated with linagliptin + metformin, 6 (2.1%) of 291 subjects treated with metformin, and 1 (1.4%) of 72 subjects treated with placebo. When linagliptin was administered in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, 181 (22.9%) of 792 patients reported hypoglycemia compared with 39 (14.8%) of 263 patients administered placebo in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea. Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. Linagliptin In the study of patients receiving linagliptin as add-on therapy to a stable dose of insulin for up to 52 weeks (n=1261), no significant difference in the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia, defined as all symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes with a self-measured blood glucose 70 mg/dL, was noted between the linagliptin- (31.4%) and placebo- (32.9%) treated groups. Use in Renal Impairment Linagliptin was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe renal impairment (estimated GFR <30 mL/min). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed. In general, the incidence of adverse events including severe hypoglycemia was similar to those reported in other linagliptin trials. The observed incidence of hypoglycemia was higher (linagliptin, 63% compared to placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemic events especially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies were kept stable. Ten linagliptin-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated patients (17%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying finger stick glucose 54 mg/dL). During the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 3 (4.4%) linagliptin-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on linagliptin and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo. Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks treatment compared to placebo. Laboratory Tests Linagliptin Increase in Uric Acid: Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the linagliptin group and 1% more than in the placebo group were increases in uric acid (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the linagliptin group). Increase in Lipase: In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with linagliptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, a mean increase of 30% in lipase concentrations from baseline to 24 weeks was observed in the linagliptin arm compared to a mean decrease of 2% in the placebo arm. Lipase levels above 3 times upper limit of normal were seen in 8.2% compared to 1.7% patients in the linagliptin and placebo arms, respectively. Metformin Decrease in Vitamin B12 Absorption: Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Linagliptin Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Severe and disabling arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Bullous pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Rash Mouth ulceration, stomatitis Metformin Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury","drugClass":"linagliptin","maximumDoseSchedule":"2DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize the starting dose of JENTADUETO based on the patient's current regimen (2.1) The maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin twice daily (2.1) Give twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal effects due to metformin (2.1) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (2.2) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 - 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Assess risk/benefit of continuing if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 JENTADUETO may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosing The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily. JENTADUETO should be given twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with metformin use. For available dosage forms and strengths [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)]. Recommended starting dose: In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily In patients already treated with metformin, start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of the two daily meals (e.g., a patient on metformin 1000 mg twice daily would be started on 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily with meals). Patients already treated with linagliptin and metformin individual components may be switched to JENTADUETO containing the same doses of each component. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JENTADUETO in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JENTADUETO. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur. 2.2 Recommended Dosing in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of JENTADUETO and periodically thereafter. JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of JENTADUETO in patients with an-eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking JENTADUETO whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue JENTADUETO if the patients eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue JENTADUETO at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

Among patients taking either glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg/250 mg or glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg, 9 (2.6%) patients discontinued glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets due to hypoglycemic symptoms and 1 required medical intervention due to hypoglycemia. In a controlled second-line therapy trial of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/500 mg, the numbers of patients with hypoglycemia documented by symptoms and a fingerstick blood glucose measurement 50 mg/dL were 0 (0%) for glipizide, 1 (1.3%) for metformin, and 11 (12.6%) for glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. One (1.1%) patient discontinued glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy due to hypoglycemic symptoms and none required medical intervention due to hypoglycemia (see PRECAUTIONS). Gastrointestinal Reactions Among the most common clinical adverse events in the initial therapy trial were diarrhea and nausea/vomiting; the incidences of these events were lower with both glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets dosage strengths than with metformin therapy.

Glipizide Gastrointestinal Reactions Cholestatic and hepatocellular forms of liver injury accompanied by jaundice have been reported rarely in association with glipizide; glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued if this occurs.","drugClass":"glipizide","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations Dosage of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tabletsmust be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide extended-release tablets, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Alone For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. For patients whose FPG is 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL a starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg twice daily should be considered. The efficacy of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients whose FPG exceeds 320 mg/dL has not been established. Dosage increases to achieve adequate glycemic control should be made in increments of 1 tablet per day every 2 weeks up to maximum of 10 mg/1000 mg or 10 mg/2000 mg glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets per day given in divided doses. In clinical trials of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day. Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patients eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see WARNINGS). Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. Specific Patient Populations Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).","activeIngredient":3085290},{"uuid":"0310-6225","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET, FILM COATED, EXTENDED RELEASE","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"XIGDUO","proprietaryName":"AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XIGDUO XR (dapagliflozin and metformin HCl extended-release) is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both dapagliflozin and metformin is appropriate [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. XIGDUO XR is a combination of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and metformin, a biguanide, indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both dapagliflozin and metformin is appropriate.

Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (5.2, 6.1) Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue XIGDUO XR, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating XIGDUO XR, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on XIGDUO XR may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. (5.3) Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in renal function: Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat. Monitor renal function during therapy. (5.4) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. (5.5) Hypoglycemia: In patients taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue with XIGDUO XR, consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

(5.10) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with XIGDUO XR. (5.11) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of XIGDUO XR. In XIGDUO XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue XIGDUO XR and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patients renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: Before initiating XIGDUO XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking XIGDUO XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of XIGDUO XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g. cationic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patients age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop XIGDUO XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart XIGDUO XR if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. XIGDUO XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue XIGDUO XR. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving XIGDUO XR. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of XIGDUO XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Hypotension Dapagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating dapagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics. Before initiating XIGDUO XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy. 5.3 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus taking sodium-glucose co transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking dapagliflozin. XIGDUO XR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1.1) ]. Patients treated with XIGDUO XR who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with XIGDUO XR may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, XIGDUO XR should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement. In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified. Before initiating XIGDUO XR, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with XIGDUO XR consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing XIGDUO XR in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). 5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function Dapagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) ], and can cause renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving dapagliflozin: some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. Before initiating XIGDUO XR, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing XIGDUO XR in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue XIGDUO XR promptly and institute treatment. Dapagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more susceptible to these changes. Adverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating XIGDUO XR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of XIGDUO XR and monitored periodically thereafter. XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Dapagliflozin Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with XIGDUO XR. Metformin hydrochloride Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. 5.7 Vitamin B12</sub Concentrations In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. This decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on XIGDUO XR and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful. 5.8 Genital Mycotic Infections Dapagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor and treat appropriately. 5.9 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Increases in LDL-C occur with dapagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor LDL-C and treat per standard of care after initiating XIGDUO XR. 5.10 Bladder Cancer Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with dapagliflozin and 1/3512 patient (0.03%) treated with placebo/comparator. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 4 cases with dapagliflozin and no cases with placebo/comparator. Bladder cancer risk factors and hematuria (a potential indicator of pre-existing tumors) were balanced between treatment arms at baseline. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to dapagliflozin. There are insufficient data to determine whether dapagliflozin has an effect on pre-existing bladder tumors. Consequently, XIGDUO XR should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. In patients with prior history of bladder cancer, the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with XIGDUO XR should be considered. 5.11 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with XIGDUO XR.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with: Moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), end stage renal disease or patients on dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].

Dapagliflozin and Metformin hydrochloride Data from a prespecified pool of patients from 8 short-term, placebo-controlled studies of dapagliflozin coadministered with metformin immediate- or extended-release was used to evaluate safety. This pool included several add-on studies (metformin alone and in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4] inhibitor and metformin, or insulin and metformin, 2 initial combination with metformin studies, and 2 studies of patients with cardiovascular disease [CVD] and type 2 diabetes who received their usual treatment [with metformin as background therapy]). For studies that included background therapy with and without metformin, only patients who received metformin were included in the 8-study placebo-controlled pool. Across these 8 studies 983 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin and 1185 were treated with placebo and metformin. These 8 studies provide a mean duration of exposure of 23 weeks. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years. Fifty-four percent (54%) of the population was male; 88% White, 6% Asian, and 3% Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.4%, and renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 90% of patients and moderately impaired in 10% of patients. The overall incidence of adverse events for the 8-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pool in patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin was 60.3% compared to 58.2% for the placebo and metformin group. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events in patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin was 4% compared to 3.3% for the placebo and metformin group. The most commonly reported events leading to discontinuation and reported in at least 3 patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin were renal impairment (0.7%), increased blood creatinine (0.2%), decreased renal creatinine clearance (0.2%), and urinary tract infection (0.2%). Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of dapagliflozin and metformin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin and metformin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin extended-release. Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Studies for Dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg Dapagliflozin The data in Table 2 are derived from 12 placebo-controlled studies ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 studies dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy, and in 8 studies dapagliflozin was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data reflect exposure of 2338 patients to dapagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=1393), dapagliflozin 5 mg (N=1145), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (N=1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m2). Table 2 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of dapagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled studies, including 3 monotherapy studies, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy studies, and an initial combination with metformin study. Across these 13 studies, 2360 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m2). Volume Depletion Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) are shown in Table 3 for the 12-study and 13-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pools [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2 Table 3: Adverse Reactions of Volume DepletionVolume depletion includes reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension. in Clinical Studies with Dapagliflozin Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Studies Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Studies Placebo Dapagliflozin 5 mg Dapagliflozin 10 mg Placebo Dapagliflozin 10 mg Overall population N (%) N=1393 5 (0.4%) N=1145 7 (0.6%) N=1193 9 (0.8%) N=2295 17 (0.7%) N=2360 27 (1.1%) Patient Subgroup n (%) Patients on loop diuretics n=55 1 (1.8%) n=40 0 n=31 3 (9.7%) n=267 4 (1.5%) n=236 6 (2.5%) Patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 and Impairment of Renal Function Use of dapagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 4). In patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function at baseline, serum creatinine and eGFR returned to baseline values at Week 24. Renal-related adverse reactions, including renal failure and blood creatinine increase, were more frequent in patients treated with dapagliflozin (see Table 5). Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function were more susceptible to these adverse reactions (see Table 5). Sustained decreases in eGFR were seen in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Table 6: Incidence of MajorMajor episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as symptomatic episodes requiring external (third party) assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavior with a capillary or plasma glucose value Genital Mycotic Infections Genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-study placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 2). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the study than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively). Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with dapagliflozin treatment. Across the clinical program, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of dapagliflozin-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of dapagliflozin; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Laboratory Tests Increase in Hematocrit Dapagliflozin In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in dapagliflozin-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were 0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. By Week 24, hematocrit values >55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of dapagliflozin 10 mgtreated patients. Increase in Serum Inorganic Phosphorus Dapagliflozin In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean serum phosphorus levels were reported at Week 24 in dapagliflozin 10 mgtreated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (mean increases of 0.13 mg/dL versus 0.04 mg/dL, respectively). Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities of hyperphosphatemia (5.6 mg/dL if age 17-65 or 5.1 mg/dL if age 66) were reported in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group versus the placebo group at Week 24 (1.7% versus 0.9%, respectively). Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, changes from baseline in mean lipid values were reported in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Mean percent change from baseline at Week 24 were 0.0% versus 2.5% for total cholesterol and 1.0% versus 2.9% for LDL cholesterol in the placebo and dapagliflozin 10 mg groups, respectively. Vitamin B12</sub Concentrations Metformin hydrochloride Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on XIGDUO XR and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Dapagliflozin Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of dapagliflozin.

Do not initiate or continue if eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. (2.2, 4) No dosage adjustment is indicated in patients with mild renal impairment. (2.2) XIGDUO XR may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Healthcare providers should individualize the starting dose of XIGDUO XR based on the patients current treatment [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ]. XIGDUO XR should be taken once daily in the morning with food with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. XIGDUO XR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed, cut, or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of XIGDUO XR will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass that may resemble the original tablet. For patients not already taking dapagliflozin, the recommended starting dose for dapagliflozin is 5 mg once daily. For patients requiring a dose of 5 mg dapagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin HCl extended-release, use two of the 2.5 mg dapagliflozin/1000 mg metformin HCl extended-release tablets. Dosing may be adjusted based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin HCl. Patients taking an evening dose of metformin XR should skip their last dose before starting XIGDUO XR. In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of XIGDUO XR is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 2.2 Patients with Renal Impairment Assess renal function before initiating XIGDUO XR therapy and periodically thereafter. XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. No dose adjustment for XIGDUO XR is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or greater). 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue XIGDUO XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart XIGDUO XR if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].","activeIngredient":3098941},{"uuid":"65162-175","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Metformin Hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"Amneal Pharmaceuticals","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metformin HCl Tablets, USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","warning":null,"contraindication":"CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin HCl, USP is contraindicated in patients with: Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels 1.5 mg/dL [males], 1.4 mg/dL [females] or abnormal creatinine clearance) which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicemia (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ).

Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with Metformin HCl in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes, the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults.","drugClass":"metformin","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with Metformin HCl, USP or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of Metformin HCl, USP must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin HCl, USP is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age). Metformin HCl, USP should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin HCl, USP should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule ), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Metformin HCl, USP and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of Metformin HCl, USP, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of Metformin HCl, USP may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults - In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl Tablets, USP is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, Metformin HCl, USP may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals. If higher doses of metformin are required, Metformin HCl, USP should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses, as described above. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies .) Pediatrics - The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl, USP is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to Metformin HCl, USP, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of Metformin HCl, USP monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing Metformin HCl, USP at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on Metformin HCl, USP 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of Metformin HCl, USP and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies ). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.) If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of Metformin HCl, USP and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without Metformin HCl, USP. Concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of Metformin HCl, USP therapy. Metformin HCl, USP therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of Metformin HCl, USP should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for Metformin HCl, USP. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and Metformin HCl, USP. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response. Specific Patient Populations Metformin HCl, USP is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin HCl, USP is not recommended in patients below the age of 10 years. The initial and maintenance dosing of Metformin HCl, USP should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Metformin HCl, USP. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.

Glipizide Gastrointestinal Reactions Cholestatic and hepatocellular forms of liver injury accompanied by jaundice have been reported rarely in association with glipizide; Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be discontinued if this occurs.","drugClass":"glipizide","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations Dosage of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Alone For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are 2.5 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. For patients whose FPG is 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL a starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg twice daily should be considered. The efficacy of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients whose FPG exceeds 320 mg/dL has not been established. Dosage increases to achieve adequate glycemic control should be made in increments of 1 tablet per day every 2 weeks up to maximum of 10 mg/1000 mg or 10 mg/2000 mg Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets per day given in divided doses. In clinical trials of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses >10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day. Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and periodically thereafter. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . Initiation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 - 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is not recommended. In patients taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . (See WARNINGS .) Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets if renal function is stable. Specific Patient Populations Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.

(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies.) In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies). Pediatrics - Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred.

Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg for metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response. Specific Patient Populations Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients (below the age of 17 years). The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (See WARNINGS.)

Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial), and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients ( 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial), and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year. Adverse events reported in 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1,483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/L) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials. Table 10: Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil.","drugClass":"mycophenolate mofetil","maximumDoseSchedule":"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Renal Transplantation Adults A dose of 1 g administered orally twice a day (daily dose of 2 g) is recommended for use in renal transplant patients. Although a dose of 1.5 g administered twice daily (daily dose of 3 g) was used in clinical trials and was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. Pediatrics (3 Months to 18 years of Age) The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension is 600 mg/m2 administered twice daily (up to a maximum daily dose of 2 g/10 mL oral suspension). Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 m2 to 1.5 m2 may be dosed with mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area > 1.5 m2 may be dosed with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or tablets at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). Cardiac Transplantation Adults A dose of 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose of 3 g) is recommended for use in adult cardiac transplant patients. Hepatic Transplantation Adults A dose of 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose of 3 g) is recommended for use in adult hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate Mofetil Capsules and Tablets The initial oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil should be given as soon as possible following renal, cardiac or hepatic transplantation. Food had no effect on MPA AUC, but has been shown to decrease MPA Cmax by 40%. Therefore, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil be administered on an empty stomach. However, in stable renal transplant patients, mycophenolate mofetil may be administered with food if necessary. Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose, and then continue to take mycophenolate mofetil at the usual times. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustments are recommended for renal patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. However, it is not known whether dose adjustments are needed for hepatic disease with other etiologies (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). No data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. Geriatrics The recommended oral dose of 1 g bid for renal transplant patients, 1.5 g bid for cardiac transplant patients, and 1.5 g bid administered orally in hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for elderly patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use). Dosage Adjustments In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (GFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) outside the immediate posttransplant period, doses of mycophenolate mofetil greater than 1 g administered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose adjustments are needed in renal transplant patients experiencing delayed graft function postoperatively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Patients with Renal Impairment). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. Mycophenolate mofetil may be used for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. If neutropenia develops (ANC < 1.3 x 103/L), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, ADVERSE REACTIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).","activeIngredient":3058019},{"uuid":"70518-0442","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"buprenorphine hydrochloride","proprietaryName":"REMEDYREPACK INC.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and is preferred for induction. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and is preferred for induction. Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. ( 1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. ( 5.1) Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). ( 5.2) Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. ( 5.3) Store Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. ( 5.4) Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy ( 5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off the opioid. ( 5.6) Chronic administration produces opioid-type physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose taper may result in opioid withdrawal syndrome. ( 5.7) Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. ( 5.8) Do not administer Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets to patients with known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine. ( 5.9) Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually or parenterally before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. ( 5.10) Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are NOT appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose of buprenorphine. ( 5.11) Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and a dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 5.12) Caution patients about the risk of driving or operating hazardous machinery. ( 5.13) 5.1 Abuse Potential Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self-injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)]. In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 CNS Depression Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately . [see Patient Counseling ( 17)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Dependence Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)]. 5.8 Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Allergic Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneutrotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually or parenterally before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. 5.11 Use in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function In a pharmacokinetic study, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment is recommended, and patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]. 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 5.18 General Precautions Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be administered with caution in debilitated patients and those with myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine, as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.

Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2)] .","drugClass":"buprenorphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets contain no naloxone HCL and is preferred for use only during induction. Following induction, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film or Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is preferred due to the presence of naloxone when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film or Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets; for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Administer Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets sublingually as a single daily dose. ( 2) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. ( 2.1) Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film CIII or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet CIII is generally initiated after two days of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets titration. ( 2) 2.1 Induction Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet or Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. Patients taking heroin or other short-acting opioids: At treatment initiation, the dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear. </paragraph </text </section </component Patients on methadone or other long-acting opioids: There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (greater than 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets dosing should be initiated preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear. </paragraph </text </section </component </section </component 2.2 Maintenance Buprenorphine and naloxone is preferred for maintenance treatment. Where buprenorphine is used in maintenance in patients who cannot tolerate the presence of naloxone, the dosage of buprenorphine should be progressively adjusted in increments / decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg buprenorphine to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. The maintenance dose is generally in the range of 4 mg to 24 mg buprenorphine per day depending on the individual patient. Doses higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. 2.3 Method of Administration Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.4 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. The use of buprenorphine for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone, for example those patients with known hypersensitivity to naloxone. Buprenorphine and naloxone and buprenorphine are both subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the size of the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability of the patient to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally, patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physician's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: Absence of medication toxicity. Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects. Responsible handling of medications by the patient. Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities). Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use). If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.5 Patients With Hepatic Impairment Severe hepatic impairment: Consider reducing the starting and titration incremental dose by half compared to patients with normal liver function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Moderate hepatic impairment: Although no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used with caution in these patients and prescribers should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Mild hepatic impairment: No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11)] . 2.6 Unstable Patients Physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.7 Stopping Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment.","activeIngredient":3083933},{"uuid":"65162-415","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Buprenorphine HCl and Naloxone HCl","proprietaryName":"Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence.

(1) Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. (5.1) Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine use. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepine or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. (5.2, 5.3) Accidental Exposure: Store Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. (5.4) Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately. (5.7) Risk of Hepatitis; Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. (5.8) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal: An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists, or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. (5.10) Risk of Overdose in Opioid-Nave Patients: Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose. (5.11) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contain buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)]. Use Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone. As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate. For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patients buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use. In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Disposal of Unused B uprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets (17) ]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid-type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. When discontinuing Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 5.11 Risk of Overdosein Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphines efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphines efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

The safety of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets was evaluated in 497 opioid-dependent subjects. The prospective evaluation of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets was supported by clinical trials using SUBUTEX (buprenorphine tablets without naloxone) and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and SUBUTEX or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequently reported post-marketing adverse event not observed in clinical trials was peripheral edema. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets.

(2.1) Administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingually as a single daily dose. (2.2) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be administered in divided doses when used as initial treatment. (2.3) The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets for maintenance is 16 mg/4 mg. (2.3) Administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets as directed in the Full Prescribing Information. (2.3, 2.4) When discontinuing treatment, gradually taper to avoid signs and symptoms of withdrawal. (2.7) 2.1 Drug Addiction Treatment Act Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. 2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. 2.3 Maintenance The dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. The maintenance dose of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals. 2.4 Method of Administration Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.5 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patients clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare providers evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: Absence of medication toxicity Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects Responsible handling of medications by the patient Patients compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities) Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use) If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.6 Unstable Patients Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.7 Discontinuing Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 2.8 Switching between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets Patients being switched between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be started on the same dosage as the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between products. Because of the potentially greater relative bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film compared to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, patients switching from Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be monitored for over-medication. Those switching from buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of under dosing. In clinical studies, pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was similar to the respective dosage strengths of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, although not all doses and dose combinations met bioequivalence criteria.","activeIngredient":3127048},{"uuid":"53217-138","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Buprenorphine and Naloxone","proprietaryName":"Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.

(1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. (5.1) Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). (5.2) Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. (5.3) Store Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. (5.4) Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off the opioid. (5.6) Chronic administration produces opioid-type physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose taper may result in opioid withdrawal syndrome. (5.7) Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. (5.8) Do not administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets to patients with known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone. (5.9) A marked and intense opioid withdrawal syndrome is highly likely to occur with parenteral misuse of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. (5.10) Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose. (5.11) Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (5.12) Caution patients about the risk of driving or operating hazardous machinery. (5.13) 5.1 Abuse Potential Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self-injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 CNS Depression Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Disposal of Unused Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets (17)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency 5.7 Dependence Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 5.8 Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Allergic Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone-containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 5.11 Use in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Buprenorphine/ naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may interfere with buprenorphines efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphines efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablet therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 5.18 General Precautions Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be administered with caution in debilitated patients and those with myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].","drugClass":"buprenorphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingually as a single daily dose. (2) The recommended daily dose for maintenance is 16 mg/4 mg. 2.1 Maintenance Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are indicated for maintenance treatment. The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. The dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. The maintenance dose of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. Dosages higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. 2.2 Method of Administration Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.3 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patients clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physicians evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: Absence of medication toxicity Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects Responsible handling of medications by the patient Patients compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities) Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use) If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.4 Unstable Patients Physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.5 Patients With Hepatic Impairment Because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated, severe hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, and moderate hepatic impairment also results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a greater extent than buprenorphine, the combination product should generally be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 2.6 Stopping Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment. 2.7 Switching Between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets Patients being switched between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be started on the same dosage as the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between products. Because of the potentially greater relative bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film compared to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, patients switching from Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be monitored for over-medication. Those switching from buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of under-dosing. In clinical studies, pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was similar to the respective dosage strengths of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, although not all doses and dose combinations met bioequivalence criteria.","activeIngredient":3059604},{"uuid":"59011-751","administrationRoute":"TRANSDERMAL","dosageForm":"PATCH, EXTENDED RELEASE","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Butrans","proprietaryName":"Purdue Pharma LP","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BUTRANS is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

(5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) Risk of Prolonged QTc Interval: Avoid in patients with Long QT Syndrome, family history of Long QT Syndrome, or those taking Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic medications. (5.7, 12.2) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. Avoid use of BUTRANS in patients with circulatory shock (5.8) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Cranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of BUTRANS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.9) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse BUTRANS contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, BUTRANS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Because extended-release products such as BUTRANS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death, due to the larger amount of buprenorphine present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed BUTRANS. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing BUTRANS, and monitor all patients receiving BUTRANS for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as BUTRANS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of BUTRANS, along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, or misuse. Abuse or misuse of BUTRANS by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing BUTRANS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of BUTRANS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of BUTRANS. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of BUTRANS are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the BUTRANS dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to BUTRANS, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of buprenorphine. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of BUTRANS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patients Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of BUTRANS with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when BUTRANS is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of BUTRANS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: BUTRANS-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of BUTRANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating BUTRANS and when BUTRANS is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 QTc Prolongation A positive-controlled study of the effects of BUTRANS on the QTc interval in healthy subjects demonstrated no clinically meaningful effect at a BUTRANS dose of 10 mcg/hour; however, a BUTRANS dose of 40 mcg/hour (given as two BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour Transdermal Systems) was observed to prolong the QTc interval. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing BUTRANS to patients with hypokalemia or clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia. Avoid the use of BUTRANS in patients with a history of Long QT Syndrome or an immediate family member with this condition, or those taking Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide), or other medications that prolong the QTc interval [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)], Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.8 Severe Hypotension BUTRANS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of BUTRANS. In patients with circulatory shock, BUTRANS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of BUTRANS in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), BUTRANS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with BUTRANS. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of BUTRANS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence, both in clinical trials and in post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitisB or hepatitisC virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injection drug abuse may have played a causative or contributory role. For patients at increased risk of hepatotoxicity (e.g., patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake, intravenous drug abuse or liver disease), obtain baseline liver enzyme levels and monitor periodically and during treatment with BUTRANS. 5.11 Application Site Skin Reactions In rare cases, severe application site skin reactions with signs of marked inflammation including burn, discharge, and vesicles have occurred. Time of onset varies, ranging from days to months following the initiation of BUTRANS treatment. Instruct patients to promptly report the development of severe application site reactions and discontinue therapy. 5.12 Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of BUTRANS. 5.13 Risks of Use with Application of External Heat Advise patients and their caregivers to avoid exposing the BUTRANS application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds while wearing the system because an increase in absorption of buprenorphine may occur[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Advise patients against exposure of the BUTRANS application site and surrounding area to hot water or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. There is a potential for temperature-dependent increases in buprenorphine released from the system resulting in possible overdose and death [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.14 Risk of Use in Patients with Fever Monitor patients wearing BUTRANS systems who develop fever or increased core body temperature due to strenuous exertion for opioid side effects and adjust the BUTRANS dose if signs of respiratory or central nervous system depression occur. 5.15 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions BUTRANS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The buprenorphine in BUTRANS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.16 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The buprenorphine in BUTRANS may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during BUTRANS therapy. 5.17 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery BUTRANS may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of BUTRANS and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.18 Use in Addiction Treatment BUTRANS has not been studied and is not approved for use in the management of addictive disorders.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS BUTRANS is contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to buprenorphine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Adverse Reactions (6)] Significant respiratory depression (4) Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment (4) Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus (4) Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine (4)","howSupplied":"16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING BUTRANS Transdermal System is supplied in cartons containing 4 individually-packaged systems and a pouch containing 4 Patch-Disposal Units.

A total of 5,415 patients were treated with BUTRANS in controlled and open-label chronic pain clinical trials. Nine hundred twenty-four subjects were treated for approximately six months and 183 subjects were treated for approximately one year. The clinical trial population consisted of patients with persistent moderate to severe pain. The most common serious adverse drug reactions (all <0.1%) occurring during clinical trials with BUTRANS were: chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration, and hypertension/blood pressure increased.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in BUTRANS. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].","drugClass":"buprenorphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To be prescribed only by healthcare providers knowledgeable in use of potent opioids for management of chronic pain. (2.1) BUTRANS doses of 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mcg/hour are only for use in patients who are opioid experienced and in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients who are opioid-experienced are those receiving, for one week or longer, daily opioid doses up to 80 mg/day of oral morphine or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (2.1). Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) For opioid-nave patients, initiate treatment with a 5 mcg/hour patch. (2.1) Instruct patients to wear BUTRANS for 7 days and to wait a minimum of 3 weeks before applying to the same site. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue BUTRANS in a physically dependent patient. (2.3) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information BUTRANS should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. BUTRANS doses of 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mcg/hour are only for use in patients who are opioid experienced and in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients who are opioid-experienced are those receiving, for one week or longer, daily opioid doses up to 80 mg/day of oral morphine or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patients treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with BUTRANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct patients not to use BUTRANS if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way and not to cut BUTRANS. Instruct patients to avoid exposing BUTRANS to external heat sources, hot water, or prolonged direct sunlight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. BUTRANS is for transdermal use (on intact skin) only. Each BUTRANS patch is intended to be worn for 7 days. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of BUTRANS as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naive patients) Initiate treatment with BUTRANS with a 5 mcg/hour patch. Conversion from Other Opioids to BUTRANS Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when BUTRANS therapy is initiated. There is a potential for buprenorphine to precipitate withdrawal in patients who are already on opioids. Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Less than 30 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: Initiate treatment with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, middle column). Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Between 30 mg to 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: Taper the patients current around-the-clock opioids for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with BUTRANS. Then initiate treatment with BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, right column). Patients may use short-acting analgesics as needed until analgesic efficacy with BUTRANS is attained. Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Greater than 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 80 mg/day oral morphine equivalents. Consider the use of an alternate analgesic. Table 1: Initial BUTRANS Dose Conversion from Methadone to BUTRANS Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. 2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate BUTRANS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving BUTRANS to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics. The minimum BUTRANS titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady state levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The maximum BUTRANS dose is 20 mcg/hour. Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour BUTRANS system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. In a clinical trial, BUTRANS 40 mcg/hour (given as two BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour systems) resulted in prolongation of the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment increase of BUTRANS, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the BUTRANS dose. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 72 hours, BUTRANS dosage may be adjusted every 3 days. Dose adjustments may be made in 5 mcg/hour, 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour increments by using no more than two patches of the 5 mcg/hour, or 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour system(s). The total dose from both patches should not exceed 20 mcg/hour. For the use of two patches, instruct patients to remove their current patch, and apply the two new patches at the same time, adjacent to one another at a different application site [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between the management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.4 Discontinuation of BUTRANS When the patient no longer requires therapy with BUTRANS, use a gradual downward titration of the dose every 7 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, consider introduction of an appropriate immediate-release opioid medication. Do not abruptly discontinue BUTRANS. 2.5 Patients with Hepatic Impairment BUTRANS has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. As BUTRANS is only intended for 7-day application, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 2.6 Administration of BUTRANS Instruct patients to apply immediately after removal from the individually sealed pouch. Instruct patients not to use BUTRANS if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. See the Instructions for Use for step-by-step instructions for applying BUTRANS. Apply BUTRANS to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side of the chest. These 4 sites (each present on both sides of the body) provide 8 possible application sites. Rotate BUTRANS among the 8 described skin sites. After BUTRANS removal, wait a minimum of 21 days before reapplying to the same skin site [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Apply BUTRANS to a hairless or nearly hairless skin site. If none are available, the hair at the site should be clipped, not shaven. Do not apply BUTRANS to irritated skin. If the application site must be cleaned, clean the site with water only. Do not use soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions, or abrasive devices. Allow the skin to dry before applying BUTRANS. Incidental exposure of the BUTRANS patch to water, such as while bathing or showering is acceptable based on experience during clinical studies. If problems with adhesion of BUTRANS occur, the edges may be taped with first aid tape. If problems with lack of adhesion continue, the patch may be covered with waterproof or semipermeable adhesive dressings suitable for 7 days of wear. If BUTRANS falls off during the 7-day dosing interval, dispose of the transdermal system properly and place a new BUTRANS patch on at a different skin site. When changing the system, instruct patients to remove BUTRANS and dispose of it properly [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. If the buprenorphine-containing adhesive matrix accidentally contacts the skin, instruct patients or caregivers to wash the area with water and not to use soap, alcohol, or other solvents to remove the adhesive because they may enhance the absorption of the drug. 2.7 Disposal Instructions Patients should refer to the Instructions for Use for proper disposal of BUTRANS. Dispose of used and unused patches by following the instructions on the Patch-Disposal Unit that is packaged with the BUTRANS patches. Alternatively, patients can dispose of used patches by folding the adhesive side of the patch to itself, then flushing the patch down the toilet immediately upon removal. Unused patches should be removed from their pouches, the protective liners removed, the patches folded so that the adhesive side of the patch adheres to itself, and immediately flushed down the toilet. Patients should dispose of any patches remaining from a prescription as soon as they are no longer needed.","activeIngredient":3088299},{"uuid":"0054-0176","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Buprenorphine HCl","proprietaryName":"West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp.","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and are preferred for induction. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. Buprenorphine sublingual tablets, contain buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, and is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and is preferred for induction. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. (5.1) Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine use. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets (5.2, 5.3). Accidental Exposure: Store buprenorphine sublingual tablet safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. (5.4) Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately. (5.7) Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events.(5.8) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal: An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse of buprenorphine sublingual tablet by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists, or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. (5.10) Risk of Overdose in Opioid-Nave Patients: Buprenorphine sublingual tablet is NOT appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose of buprenorphine. (5.11) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets contain buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Use Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 Managing Risks From Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone. As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate. For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patients buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use. In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Patient Counseling (17)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. When discontinuing Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)]. 5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually or parenterally before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. 5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function In a pharmacokinetic study, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment is recommended, and patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine, as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

The safety of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets was supported by clinical trials using Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study (Table 1).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequently reported postmarketing adverse events with buprenorphine not observed in clinical trials, excluding drug exposure during pregnancy, was drug misuse or abuse. Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal Insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. Androgen Deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other: glossodynia, glossitis, oral mucosal erythema, oral hypoesthesia, and stomatitis","drugClass":"buprenorphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. (2.1) Administer buprenorphine sublingual tablet sublingually as a single daily dose. (2.2) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine sublingual tablet should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. (2.3). Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are generally initiated after two days of buprenorphine sublingual tablet titration. (2.3) Administer buprenorphine sublingual tablets as directed in the Full Prescribing Information (2.3, 2.4). Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. (2.5) When discontinuing treatment, gradually taper to avoid signs and symptoms of withdrawal. (2.9) 2.1 Drug Addiction Treatment Act Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. 2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets do not contain naloxone and is preferred for use only during induction. Following induction, buprenorphine sublingual film or buprenorphine sublingual tablet is preferred due to the presence of naloxone when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine sublingual film or buprenorphine sublingual tablet; for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. 2.3 Induction Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. Patients Dependent on Heroin or Other Short-acting Opioid Products At treatment initiation, the first dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be administered only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 4 hours after the patient last used an opioid. It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either Buprenorphine Sublingual Film or Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3-4 days, depending on the target dose. Patients Dependent on Methadone or Other Long-acting Opioid Products: Patients dependent upon methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products; therefore, the first dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should only be administered when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and generally not less than 24 hours after the patient last used a long-acting opioid product. There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (>30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose. 2.4 Maintenance Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are preferred for maintenance treatment. Where Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is used in maintenance in patients who cannot tolerate the presence of naloxone, the dosage of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments / decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg buprenorphine to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. After treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is generally in the range of 4 mg to 24 mg buprenorphine per day depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets is 16 mg as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and the use of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals. 2.5 Method of Administration Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved. Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.6 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patients clinical stability permits. The use of buprenorphine for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone, for example those patients with known hypersensitivity to naloxone. Buprenorphine and naloxone and buprenorphine are both subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the size of the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability of the patient to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally, patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physicians evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: 1.Absence of medication toxicity. 2.Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects. 3.Responsible handling of medications by the patient. 4.Patients compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities). 5.Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use). If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.7 Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment Consider reducing the starting and titration incremental dose by half and monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. 2.8 Unstable Patients Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.9 Discontinuing Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )].","activeIngredient":3078471},{"uuid":"35356-004","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Suboxone","proprietaryName":"Lake Erie Medical & Surgical Supply DBA Quality Care Products LLC","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.

(1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stabilityis essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. (5.1) Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). (5.2) Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, SUBOXONE sublingual tablet, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. (5.3) Store SUBOXONE sublingual tablet safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. (5.4) Chronic administration produces opioid-type physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose taper may result in opioid withdrawal syndrome. (5.5) Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. (5.6) Do not administer SUBOXONE sublingual tablet to patients with known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone. (5.7) A marked and intense opioid withdrawal syndrome is highly likely to occur with parenteral misuse of SUBOXONE sublingual tablet by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. (5.8) Neonatal withdrawal has been reported following use of buprenorphine by the mother during pregnancy. (5.9) SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is not appropriate as an analgesic.There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose. (5.10) Caution patients about the risk of driving or operating hazardous machinery. (5.11) 5.1 Abuse Potential Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self-injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with SUBOXONE sublingual tablets. [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. SUBOXONE sublingual tablets should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 CNS Depression Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, SUBOXONE sublingual tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately. [see Disposal of Unused SUBOXONE Sublingual Tablets (17.2)] 5.5 Dependence Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] 5.6 Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitisB or hepatitisC virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, SUBOXONE sublingual tablet may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.7 Allergic Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of SUBOXONE sublingual tablet. 5.8 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, SUBOXONE sublingual tablet may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 5.9 Neonatal Withdrawal Neonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treated with buprenorphine during pregnancy. From post-marketing reports, the time to onset of neonatal withdrawal signs ranged from Day 1 to Day 8 of life with most cases occurring on Day 1. Adverse events associated with the neonatal withdrawal syndrome included hypertonia, neonatal tremor, neonatal agitation, and myoclonus, and there have been reports of convulsions, apnea, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. 5.10 Use in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.11 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery SUBOXONE sublingual tablet may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that SUBOXONE sublingual tablet therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.12 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, SUBOXONE sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.13 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.14 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.15 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 5.16 General Precautions SUBOXONE sublingual tablet should be administered with caution in debilitated patients and those with myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS SUBOXONE sublingual tablet should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )].

Administer SUBOXONE sublingual tablet sublingually as a single daily dose. (2) The recommended daily dose for maintenance is 16/4 mg. 2.1 Maintenance SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is indicated for maintenance treatment. The recommended target dosage of SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is 16/4mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose The dosage of SUBOXONE sublingual tablet should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2/0.5 mg or 4/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms The maintenance dose of SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is generally in the range of 4/1mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24/6mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. Dosages higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage 2.2 Method of Administration SUBOXONE sublingual tablet should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.3 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. SUBOXONE sublingual tablet is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physician's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: Absence of medication toxicity Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects Responsible handling of medications by the patient Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities) Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use) If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.4 Unstable Patients Physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.5 Stopping Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with SUBOXONE sublingual tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment. 2.6 Switching between SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Film and SUBOXONE Sublingual Tablets Patients being switched between SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets and SUBOXONE sublingual film should be started on the same dosage as the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between products. Because of the potentially greater relative bioavailability of SUBOXONE sublingual film compared to SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets, patients switching from SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets to SUBOXONE sublingual film should be monitored for over-medication. Those switching from SUBOXONE sublingual film to SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of under-dosing. In clinical studies, pharmacokinetics of SUBOXONE sublingual film was similar to the respective dosage strengths of SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets, although not all doses and dose combinations met bioequivalence criteria.","activeIngredient":3096374},{"uuid":"0054-0188","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate","proprietaryName":"West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contain buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and are indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. (1) Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support. (1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. (5.1) Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. (5.2, 5.3) Accidental Exposure: Store Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. (5.4) Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately. (5.7) Risk of Hepatitis; Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. (5.8) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal: An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists, or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. (5.10) Risk of Overdose in Opioid-Nave Patients: Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose. (5.11) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contain buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Use Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 Managing Risks From Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone. As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate. For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patients buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use. In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Disposal of Unused Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets (17)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. When discontinuing Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of preexisting liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphines efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphines efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablet therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

The safety of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets was evaluated in 497 opioid-dependent subjects. The prospective evaluation of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets was supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine sublingual tablets and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3,214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study (Table 1).

The most frequently reported post-marketing adverse event not observed in clinical trials was peripheral edema. Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

(2.1) Administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingually as a single daily dose. (2.2) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingual film should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingual tablets should be administered in divided doses when used as initial treatment. (2.3) The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingual tablet for maintenance is 16/4 mg. (2.3) Administer Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets sublingual tablets as directed in the Full Prescribing Information. (2.3, 2.4) When discontinuing treatment, gradually taper to avoid signs and symptoms of withdrawal. (2.7) 2.1 Drug Addiction and Treatment Act Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. 2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. 2.3 Maintenance The dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2/0.5 mg or 4/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms The maintenance dose of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is generally in the range of 4/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets is 16/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as patients are benefiting and the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals. 2.4 Method of Administration Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be placed under the tongue until it is dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient. 2.5 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patients clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare providers evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.6 Unstable Patients Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.7 Discontinuing Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 2.8 Switching between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets Patients being switched between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be started on the same dosage as the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between products. Because of the potentially greater relative bioavailability of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film compared to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, patients switching from Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be monitored for over-medication. Those switching from Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film to Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of under dosing. In clinical studies, pharmacokinetics of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film was similar to the respective dosage strengths of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, although not all doses and dose combinations met bioequivalence criteria.","activeIngredient":3059175},{"uuid":"67046-997","administrationRoute":"SUBLINGUAL","dosageForm":"TABLET","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"Buprenorphine Hydrochloride Sublingual","proprietaryName":"Contract Pharmacy Services-PA","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets are indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and are preferred for induction. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets, contain buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, and are indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence and are preferred for induction. Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. ( 1)","warning":"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. ( 5.1) Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). ( 5.2) Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescription. ( 5.3) Store buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. ( 5.4) Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. ( 5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.6) Chronic administration produces opioid-type physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose taper may result in opioid withdrawal syndrome. ( 5.7) Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. ( 5.8) Do not administer buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets to patients with known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine. ( 5.9) Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually or parenterally before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. ( 5.10) Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets are NOT appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose of buprenorphine. ( 5.11) Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and a dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 5.12) Caution patients about the risk of driving or operating hazardous machinery. ( 5.13) 5.1 Abuse Potential Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patients level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self-injection. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). 5.3 CNS Depression Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets, or both in situations of concomitant prescribing [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Patient Counseling (17.1)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available . This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Dependence Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 5.8 Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Allergic Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually or parenterally before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. 5.11 Use in Opioid Nave Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid nave individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function In a pharmacokinetic study, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment is recommended, and patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.13 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.14 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.15 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.16 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.17 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 5.18 General Precautions Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be administered with caution in debilitated patients and those with myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine, as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ].

The safety of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets was supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution.

The most frequently reported postmarketing adverse events with buprenorphine not observed in clinical trials, excluding drug exposure during pregnancy, was drug misuse or abuse. Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets. Androgen Deficiency Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .","drugClass":"buprenorphine","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets sublingually as a single daily dose. ( 2) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. ( 2.2) Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film CIII or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets CIII are generally initiated after two days of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets titration. 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets contain no naloxone hydrochloride and are preferred for use only during induction. Following induction, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are preferred due to the presence of naloxone when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets; for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. 2.2 Induction Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. Patients Taking Heroin or Other Short-Acting Opioids At treatment initiation, the dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear. Patients on Methadone or Other Long-Acting Opioids There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (greater than 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets dosing should be initiated preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear. 2.3 Maintenance Buprenorphine and naloxone are preferred for maintenance treatment. Where buprenorphine is used in maintenance in patients who cannot tolerate the presence of naloxone, the dosage of buprenorphine should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg buprenorphine to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. The maintenance dose is generally in the range of 4 mg to 24 mg buprenorphine per day depending on the individual patient. Doses higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. 2.4 Method of Administration Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient . 2.5 Clinical Supervision Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patients clinical stability permits. The use of buprenorphine for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone, for example those patients with known hypersensitivity to naloxone. Buprenorphine and naloxone and buprenorphine are both subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the size of the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patients level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability of the patient to manage supplies of take-home medication. Ideally, patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare providers evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as: Absence of medication toxicity. Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects. Responsible handling of medications by the patient. Patients compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities). Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use). If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment. 2.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Severe Hepatic Impairment Consider reducing the starting and titration incremental dose by half compared to patients with normal liver function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Moderate Hepatic Impairment Although no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used with caution in these patients and prescribers should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Mild Hepatic Impairment No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] . 2.7 Unstable Patients Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment. 2.8 Stopping Treatment The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment.","activeIngredient":3127423},{"uuid":"0069-0550","administrationRoute":"ORAL","dosageForm":"CAPSULE","isAvailableGenerally":true,"nameDrug":"SUTENT","proprietaryName":"Pfizer Laboratories Div Pfizer Inc","hasPrescription":true,"descriptionDrug":"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE SUTENT is a kinase inhibitor indicated for: the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

Monitor liver function tests before initiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as clinically indicated. Interrupt SUTENT for Grade 3 or 4 drug-related hepatic adverse reactions and discontinue if there is no resolution. Do not restart SUTENT if patients experience severe changes in liver function tests or have signs and symptoms of liver failure. (5.1) Cardiovascular events including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction declines to below the lower limit of normal and cardiac failure including death have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Discontinue SUTENT for clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. (5.2) Prolonged QT intervals and Torsade de Pointes have been observed. Monitor patients at higher risk for developing QT interval prolongation. Consider monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. (5.3) Hypertension may occur. Monitor blood pressure and treat as needed. (5.4) Hemorrhagic events, including tumor-related hemorrhage, and viscus perforation (both with fatal events) have occurred. Perform serial complete blood counts and physical examinations. (5.5) Cases of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) (some fatal) have been reported primarily in patients with RCC and GIST with high tumor burden. Monitor these patients closely and treat as clinically indicated. (5.6) Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes leading to renal failure or a fatal outcome, has been reported. Discontinue SUTENT in patients developing TMA. (5.7) Proteinuria, including renal failure or a fatal outcome, has occurred. Monitor urine protein. Interrupt treatment for 24-hour urine protein 3 grams. Discontinue for repeat episodes of protein 3 grams despite dose reductions or nephrotic syndrome. (5.8) Necrotizing fasciitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some fatal) have occurred. Discontinue SUTENT if these events occur. (5.9) Thyroid dysfunction may occur. Patients with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice. (5.10) Hypoglycemia may occur. Check blood glucose levels regularly and assess if antidiabetic drug dose modifications are required. (5.11) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Consider preventive dentistry prior to treatment with SUTENT. If possible, avoid invasive dental procedures, particularly in patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. (5.12) Wound Healing: Impaired wound healing has occurred with SUTENT. Temporary interruption of therapy with SUTENT is recommended in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. (5.13) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.14, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity SUTENT can cause severe hepatotoxicity, resulting in liver failure or death. Liver failure occurred at an incidence of 2.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) or, if due to liver metastases, >5.0 ULN has not been established. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events Discontinue SUTENT in the presence of clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure (CHF). Interrupt SUTENT and/or reduce the dose in patients without clinical evidence of CHF who have an ejection fraction of >20% but <50% below baseline or below the lower limit of normal if baseline ejection fraction is not obtained. In patients without cardiac risk factors a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered. Carefully monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while receiving SUTENT. Baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should also be considered while these patients are receiving SUTENT. Cardiovascular events, including heart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction, some of which were fatal, have been reported. In patients treated with SUTENT (N=7527) for GIST, advanced RCC, adjuvant treatment of RCC and pNET, 3% of patients experienced heart failure; 71% of the patients with heart failure were reported as recovered. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in <1% of patients. In the adjuvant treatment of RCC study, 11 patients in each arm experienced a decreased ejection fraction meeting Grade 2 CTCAE criteria (LVEF 4050% and a 1019% decrease from baseline). No patients had a Grade 34 decrease in ejection fraction. The ejection fractions of three patients in the SUTENT arm and 2 patients in the placebo arm did not return to 50% or baseline by the time of last measurement. No patients who received SUTENT were diagnosed with CHF. Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to SUTENT administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/unstable angina), coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic CHF, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies. It is unknown whether patients with these concomitant conditions may be at a higher risk of developing drug-related left ventricular dysfunction. 5.3 QT Interval Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes SUTENT can cause QT interval prolongation in a dose-dependent manner, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. Torsade de Pointes has been observed in <0.1% of SUTENT-exposed patients. Monitor patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. When using SUTENT, periodic monitoring with on-treatment electrocardiograms and electrolytes (magnesium, potassium) should be considered. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations and dose reduction of SUTENT should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.4 Hypertension Monitor patients for hypertension and treat as needed with standard antihypertensive therapy. In cases of severe hypertension, temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended until hypertension is controlled. In patients treated with SUTENT (N=7527) in GIST, advanced RCC, adjuvant treatment of RCC and pNET, 29% of patients experienced hypertension. Grade 3 hypertension was reported in 7% of patients, and Grade 4 hypertension was reported in 0.2% of patients. 5.5 Hemorrhagic Events and Viscus Perforation Hemorrhagic events reported through postmarketing experience, some of which were fatal, have included GI, respiratory, tumor, urinary tract, and brain hemorrhages. In patients treated with SUTENT (N=7527) for GIST, advanced RCC, adjuvant treatment of RCC and pNET, 30% of patients experienced hemorrhagic events, and 4.2% of patients experienced a Grade 3 or 4 event. Epistaxis was the most common hemorrhagic adverse reaction and gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the most common Grade 3 event. Tumor-related hemorrhage has been observed in patients treated with SUTENT. These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumors, may present as severe and life-threatening hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorrhage. Cases of pulmonary hemorrhage, some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in clinical trials and have been reported in postmarketing experience in patients treated with SUTENT for metastatic RCC, GIST, and metastatic lung cancer. SUTENT is not approved for use in patients with lung cancer. Clinical assessment of hemorrhagic events should include serial complete blood counts (CBCs) and physical examinations. Serious, sometimes fatal, gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation, have been reported in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with SUTENT. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Cases of TLS, some fatal, occurred in clinical trials and have been reported in postmarketing experience, primarily in patients with RCC or GIST treated with SUTENT. Patients generally at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor these patients closely and treat as clinically indicated. 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes leading to renal failure or a fatal outcome, occurred in clinical trials and in postmarketing experience of SUTENT as monotherapy and administered in combination with bevacizumab. Discontinue SUTENT in patients developing TMA. Reversal of the effects of TMA has been observed after treatment was discontinued. 5.8 Proteinuria Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome have been reported. Some of these cases have resulted in renal failure and fatal outcomes. Monitor patients for the development or worsening of proteinuria. Perform baseline and periodic urinalyses during treatment, with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Interrupt SUTENT and dose reduce for 24-hour urine protein 3 grams. Discontinue SUTENT for patients with nephrotic syndrome or repeat episodes of urine protein 3 grams despite dose reductions. The safety of continued SUTENT treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not been systematically evaluated. 5.9 Dermatologic Toxicities Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported, including cases of erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some of which were fatal. If signs or symptoms of EM, SJS, or TEN (e.g., progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal lesions) are present, discontinue SUTENT treatment. If a diagnosis of SJS or TEN is suspected, SUTENT treatment must not be re-started. Necrotizing fasciitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with SUTENT, including of the perineum and secondary to fistula formation. Discontinue SUTENT in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis. 5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended and patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of SUTENT treatment. All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, while on SUTENT treatment. Patients with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice. Cases of hyperthyroidism, some followed by hypothyroidism, have been reported in clinical trials and through postmarketing experience. 5.11 Hypoglycemia SUTENT can result in symptomatic hypoglycemia, which may lead to loss of consciousness, or require hospitalization. Hypoglycemia has occurred in clinical trials in 2% of the patients treated with SUTENT for advanced RCC and GIST and in approximately 10% of the patients treated with SUTENT for pNET. In the adjuvant treatment of RCC study, no patients on SUTENT experienced hypoglycemia. For patients being treated with SUTENT for pNET, pre-existing abnormalities in glucose homeostasis were not present in all patients who experienced hypoglycemia. Reductions in blood glucose levels may be worse in diabetic patients. Check blood glucose levels regularly during and after discontinuation of treatment with SUTENT. Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. 5.12 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) ONJ has been observed in clinical trials and has been reported in postmarketing experience in patients treated with SUTENT. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates or dental disease, may increase the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Consider preventive dentistry prior to treatment with SUTENT. If possible, avoid invasive dental procedures while on SUTENT treatment, particularly in patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. 5.13 Wound Healing Cases of impaired wound healing have been reported during SUTENT therapy. Temporary interruption of SUTENT therapy is recommended for precautionary reasons in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience regarding the timing of reinitiation of therapy following major surgical intervention. Therefore, the decision to resume SUTENT therapy following a major surgical intervention should be based upon clinical judgment of recovery from surgery. 5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, SUTENT can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Administration of sunitinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity at approximately 5.5 and 0.3 times the clinical systemic exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily doses (RDD) of 50 mg/day, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with SUTENT and for 4 weeks following the final dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].","contraindication":"4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None.

The data described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to SUTENT (N = 7527) in GIST, advanced RCC, adjuvant treatment of RCC, and pNET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.13)]. In this database, the most common adverse reactions (25%) are fatigue/asthenia, diarrhea, mucositis/stomatitis, nausea, decreased appetite/anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, bleeding events, dysgeusia/altered taste, dyspepsia, and thrombocytopenia. The data below reflect exposure to SUTENT in 966 patients who participated in the treatment phase of randomized trials of GIST (n=202), advanced RCC (n=375), adjuvant treatment of RCC (n=306), and pNET (n=83) [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) The safety of SUTENT was evaluated in Study 1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which previously treated patients with GIST received SUTENT 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n=202) or placebo (n=102). Median duration of blinded study treatment was 2 cycles for patients on SUTENT (mean: 3.0; range: 19) and 1 cycle (mean; 1.8; range: 16) for patients on placebo at the time of the interim analysis. Dose reductions occurred in 23 patients (11%) on SUTENT and none on placebo. Dose interruptions occurred in 59 patients (29%) on SUTENT and 31 patients (30%) on placebo. The rates of treatment-emergent, nonfatal adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were 7% and 6% in the SUTENT and placebo groups, respectively. Most treatment-emergent adverse reactions in both study arms were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse reactions were reported in 56% versus 51% of patients on SUTENT versus placebo, respectively, in the double-blind treatment phase of the trial.

For 241 patients randomized to the SUTENT arm, including 139 who received SUTENT in both the double-blind and open-label treatment phases, the median duration of SUTENT treatment was 6 cycles (mean: 8.5; range: 144). For the 255 patients who ultimately received open-label SUTENT treatment, median duration of study treatment was 6 cycles (mean: 7.8; range: 137) from the time of the unblinding. A total of 118 patients (46%) required dosing interruptions, and a total of 72 patients (28%) required dose reductions. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20%. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving SUTENT in the open-label treatment phase were fatigue (10%), hypertension (8%), asthenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), hand-foot syndrome (5%), nausea (4%), abdominal pain (3%), anorexia (3%), mucositis (2%), vomiting (2%), and hypothyroidism (2%). Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) The safety of SUTENT was evaluated in Study 3, a double-blind, active-controlled trial in which previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC received SUTENT 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n=375) or IFN- 9 million International Units (MIU) (n=360). The median duration of treatment was 11.1 months (range: 0.446.1) for SUTENT treatment and 4.1 months (range: 0.145.6) for IFN- treatment. Dose interruptions occurred in 202 patients (54%) on SUTENT and 141 patients (39%) on IFN-. Dose reductions occurred in 194 patients (52%) on SUTENT and 98 patients (27%) on IFN-. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 20% for SUTENT and 24% for IFN-. Most treatment-emergent adverse reactions in both study arms were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome There have been reports (<1%), some fatal, of patients presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). Patients with seizures and signs/symptoms consistent with RPLS, such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, and visual loss, including cortical blindness, should be controlled with medical management including control of hypertension. Temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating healthcare provider. Pancreatic Function Pancreatitis was observed in 5 patients (1%) receiving SUTENT for treatment-nave RCC compared to 1 patient (<1%) receiving IFN-. In a trial of patients receiving adjuvant treatment for RCC, 1 patient (<1%) on SUTENT and none on placebo experienced pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient (1%) receiving SUTENT for pNET and 1 patient (1%) receiving placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SUTENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopeniaincluding some fatalities.. Suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating healthcare provider. Gastrointestinal disorders: esophagitis. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis, particularly acalculous cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema. Infections and infestations: serious infection (with or without neutropenia). The infections most commonly observed with SUTENT treatment include respiratory, urinary tract, skin infections, and sepsis/septic shock. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: fistula formation, sometimes associated with tumor necrosis and/or regression; myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure. Patients with signs or symptoms of muscle toxicity should be managed as per standard medical practice. Renal and urinary disorders: renal impairment and/or failure. Respiratory disorders: pulmonary embolism. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, including positive dechallenges. Vascular disorders: arterial thromboembolic events. The most frequent events included cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and cerebral infarction.","drugClass":"sunitinib","maximumDoseSchedule":"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION GIST and Advanced RCC: 50 mg orally once daily, with or without food, 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off.

(2.4) 2.1 Recommended Dose for GIST and Advanced RCC The recommended dose of SUTENT for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one 50 mg oral dose taken once daily, on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/2). SUTENT may be taken with or without food. 2.2 Recommended Dose for Adjuvant Treatment of RCC The recommended dose of SUTENT for the adjuvant treatment of RCC is 50 mg taken orally once daily, on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/2), for nine 6-week cycles. SUTENT may be taken with or without food. 2.3 Recommended Dose for pNET The recommended dose of SUTENT for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) is 37.5 mg taken orally once daily continuously without a scheduled off-treatment period. SUTENT may be taken with or without food. 2.4 Dose Modification Dose interruption and/or dose modification in 12.5 mg increments or decrements is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. The maximum dose administered in the pNET study was 50 mg daily. In the adjuvant RCC study, the minimum dose administered was 37.5 mg. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended. A dose reduction for SUTENT to a minimum of 37.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 25 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended. A dose increase for SUTENT to a maximum of 87.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 62.5 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be coadministered with a CYP3A4 inducer. If dose is increased, the patient should be monitored carefully for toxicity [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","activeIngredient":3065430}]
