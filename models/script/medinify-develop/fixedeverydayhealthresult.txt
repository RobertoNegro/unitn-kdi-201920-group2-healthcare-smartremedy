However the side effects were horrible. The days i took dayquil, i was very drowsy (i thought dayquil was non drowsy?!). After i stopped taking it, side effects still lingered. Its been 3 days since i last took dayquil and it gave the worst anxiety. Sweating, nervousness, jittery, fast heartbeat. My cold is better but the side effects are horrible!",

Sometimes I have had an increase in mucous, taken a Mucinex DM and had very quick response - quickly enough for me to remain seated and to complete my meal. Actually, I simply have an overactive immune system for anything that it interprets might be wrong for my body. Subsequently I tend to develop fluid in my lungs - and Mucinex DM has been the most efficient treatment with the least, if any, side affects.
